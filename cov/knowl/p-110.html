<p>The type of proof used in the preceding section to show that the straight line joining 1 with 2 is shorter than every other admissible arc joining those two points is a very special one, not applicable in general to problems of the calculus of variations whose integrals \(I\) have integrands containing one or both of the variables \(x\) and \(y\) as well as \(y'\text{.}\) It will be well worth while, therefore, to consider a second form of proof which will extend somewhat the results already found for the problem of finding the shortest distance between two points, and which will be applicable not only to the problems of shortest distances considered in this chapter but also to those which we shall study later.</p>
