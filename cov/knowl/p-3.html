<p>In spite of the great abilities of Newton and Leibniz the underlying principles of the calculus as exposed by them seem to us from our modern viewpoint, as indeed to their contemporaries and immediate successors, some what vague and confusing. The difficulty lies in the lack of clearness at that early time, and for more than a century thereafter, in the conceptions of infinitesimals and limits upon which the calculus rests, a difficulty which has been overcome only by the systematic study of the theory of limits inaugurated by Cauchy (1789-1857) and continued by Weierstrass (1815-97), Riemann (1826-66), and many others.</p>
