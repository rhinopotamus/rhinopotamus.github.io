<p>If it is admitted that when two points 1 and 2 in the plane are given, a minimizing curve of the form \(y=y(x)\) joining them must be one of the catenaries <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-4-1.html" title="Equation 4.1.1">(4.1.1)</a>, then it devolves upon us at once to find out if the two points can be joined by such a curve. The analytical discussion of this problem involves computations which will be indicated in a later section, but if we are willing to forego proofs for the moment it will be easy to describe the results geometrically. In the two-parameter family of catenaries <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-4-1.html" title="Equation 4.1.1">(4.1.1)</a> those which pass through the point 1 form a one-parameter family of curves such that one of them passes through 1 in every direction, and this one-parameter family has an envelope \(G\) as shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-4-25.html" title="Figure 4.1.3">FigureÂ 4.1.3</a>. It will be proved, as may also easily be inferred intuitively from the figure, that when the initial slope of the catenary at 1 is made to increase from minus infinity to plus infinity the intersection of the catenary with the ordinate through 2 first descends from infinity to the point 3 and then ascends to infinity again. When the intersection reaches a point 2 above the envelope on its downward journey it belongs to a catenary arc which touches \(G\) between 1 and 2, and when it reaches 2 going upward it belongs to a catenary having no such contact point. We see readily then that every point 2 above the envelope G is joined to 1 by two catenaries of the family <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-4-1.html" title="Equation 4.1.1">(4.1.1)</a> only one of which touches the envelope \(G\text{;}\) a point 2 on \(G\) has only one catenary joining it to 1; and a point 2 below \(G\) has none. This is a situation very different from the corresponding one for the brachistochrone problem, where there was always a unique cycloid joining two given points, and it is one of the reasons why the catenary problem is so much more typical of the results which may in general be expected for problems of the calculus of variations in the plane.</p>
