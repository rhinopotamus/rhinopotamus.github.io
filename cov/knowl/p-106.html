<p>The difference between the lengths of \(C_{12}\) and \(E_{12}\) can now be expressed with the help of Taylor's formula in the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
I\left(C_{12}\right)-I\left(E_{12}\right) \amp= \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{1}}\left\{f\left(y^{\prime}+\eta^{\prime}\right)-f\left(y^{\prime}\right)\right\}\, dx \\
\amp=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f_{y^{\prime}} \eta^{\prime} d x+\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f_{y^{\prime} y^{\prime}}\left(y^{\prime}+\theta \eta^{\prime}\right) (\eta')^2\, dx 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(I(C_{12})\) and \(I(E_{12})\) are the values of the integral \(I\) along the two arcs; \(f_{y'y'}\) is the second derivative of the function \(f\) with respect to \(y'\text{;}\) and \(\theta\) is the value between 0 and 1 introduced by Taylor's formula. The next to last integral vanishes since \(f_{y'}\) is a constant along \(E_{12}\) and since the difference \(\eta(x)\) of the ordinates of two arcs \(C_{12}\) and \(E_{12}\) with the same end-points must vanish at \(x_1\) and \(x_2\text{.}\) Furthermore the last integral is never negative since the second derivative</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f_{y'y'} = \frac{1}{\left(1+\left(y'\right)^2\right)^{3/2}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">is always positive. We see therefore that \(I(C_{12})-I(E_{12})\) is greater than zero unless \(\eta'(x)\) vanishes identically, in which case \(\eta'(x)\) itself would have everywhere the constant value zero which it has at \(x_1\) and \(x_2\text{,}\) and \(C_{12}\) would coincide with \(E_{12}\text{.}\)</p>
