<p>In the integrand of the integral <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-iprime0.html" title="Equation 2.2.3">(2.2.3)</a> the coefficient of \(\eta'\) is really a function of \(x\text{,}\) since the derivative \(f_{y'}\) contains as its argument the slope \(y'(x)\) of the arc \(E_{12}\text{,}\) and we may denote this coefficient by \(M(x)\text{.}\) It should be noted that the function \(M(x)\) is continuous except possibly at the values of \(x\) defining the corners of the arc \(E_{12}\) where the slope \(y'(x)\) changes abruptly. At those points of the curve it has two values, one corresponding to the backward and one to the forward slope. The lemma which we wish to prove is then as follows:</p>
