<p>Here's the logic of what we just did: first we showed that if we had a minimizing arc \(E_{12}\text{,}\) then it was <em class="emphasis">necessary</em> for \(E_{12}\) to be a straight line -- that is, "if minimizing arc, then straight line."</p>
<p>Then we showed that if \(C_{12}\) was any other admissible arc (which we can think of as some variation of \(E_{12}\)), then it was definitely longer than \(E_{12}\text{,}\) unless the variation was 0. That is, we showed "if straight line, then minimizing arc" -- if we want \(E_{12}\) to be a minimizing arc, then it is <em class="emphasis">sufficient</em> for \(E_{12}\) to be a straight line.</p>
<p>For a little reminder about all of this "necessary" and "sufficient" business, please reference the earlier discussion in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/remark-necessary-sufficient.html" title="Remark 1.2.2">RemarkÂ 1.2.2</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-straight-line.html#remark-necessary-sufficient-2">in-context</a></span>
