<p>After seeing that one of the catenaries joining 1 with 2 can never be a solution of our problem, it becomes a matter of some importance to be able to prove that the remaining one, \(E_{12}\text{,}\) does furnish a minimum of some sort. This will be done by the method of Weierstrass which has already been explained for the problems of the preceding chapter. There is always a neighborhood of \(E_{12}\) in which all other arcs joining 1 with 2 generate larger surfaces of revolution than that generated by \(E_{12}\) itself.</p>
