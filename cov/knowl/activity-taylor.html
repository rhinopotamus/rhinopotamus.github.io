</h6>Okay, so the book is about to invoke some pretty deep results from <a class="external" href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-8-5-taylor.html" target="_blank">Taylor series</a>, and doesn't do much to explain them. Here's some stuff to help you figure out what's going on. <ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Write down the first few terms of the Taylor series expansion for a generic function \(f(x)\) centered at \(x=a\text{.}\) What's \(a\text{?}\) What's \(x\text{?}\)</p>
<a class="original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-12-hidden.html" title="Solution 1.1"><span class="type">Solution</span></a>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the difference between the lengths of \(C_{12}\) and \(E_{12}\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
I\left(C_{12}\right)-I\left(E_{12}\right) = \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{1}}\left[f\left(y^{\prime}+\eta^{\prime}\right)-f\left(y^{\prime}\right)\right]\, dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">In this expression, we have \(f(y')\) and \(f(y'+\eta')\) running around. Which of these do you think might be like \(f(x)\) and which of these do you think might be like \(f(a)\) in the Taylor setup?</p>
<a class="original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-13-hidden.html" title="Solution 2.1"><span class="type">Solution</span></a>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might be familiar with the idea of the <a class="external" href="https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-8-5-taylor.html#tmd" target="_blank">Lagrange error bound</a>, which describes how big the error in using the \(n\)th Taylor polynomial to calculate \(f(x)\) might be. There's a <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem#Explicit_formulas_for_the_remainder" target="_blank">slightly different version of this same idea</a> which gives a more exact value of the remainder (ie. the error):</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
R_n(x)=\frac{1}{(n+1)!} f^{(n+1)}(\xi) (x-a)^{n+1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">for some value \(\xi\) between \(x\) and \(a\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We're going to use this in the case where \(n=1\) -- that is, we're interested in the remainder after approximating \(f\) with just its linear approximation. Write out the formula above in the case where \(n=1\text{.}\)</p>
<a class="original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-14-hidden.html" title="Solution 3.1"><span class="type">Solution</span></a>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this formula for \(R_1(x)\text{,}\) substitute in what you decided for \(x\) and \(a\) in step 2. Simplify a little.</p>
<a class="original" data-knowl="./knowl/solution-15-hidden.html" title="Solution 4.1"><span class="type">Solution</span></a>
</li>
<li><p>Now we just have to think hard about \(\xi\text{,}\) which is supposed to be somewhere between \(x\) and \(a\text{.}\) In our case, that's somewhere between \(y'+\eta'\) and \(y'\text{.}\) The book is about to say that \(\xi = y'+\theta\cdot\eta'\text{,}\) where \(\theta\) is some number between 0 and 1. Why does this make sense?</p></li>
