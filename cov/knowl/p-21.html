<p>There is a second problem of the calculus of variations, of a geometrical-mechanical type, which the principles of the calculus readily enable us to express also in analytic form. When a wire circle is dipped in a soap solution and withdrawn, a circular disk of soap film bounded by the circle is formed. If a second smaller circle is made to touch this disk and then moved away the two circles will be joined by a surface of film which is a surface of revolution in the particular case when the circles are parallel and have their centers on the same axis perpendicular to their planes. The form of this surface is shown in Figure 2. It is provable by the principles of mechanics, as one may readily surmise intuitively from the elastic properties of a soap film, that the surface of revolution so formed must be one of minimum area, and the problem of determining the shape of the film is equivalent therefore to that of determining such a minimum surface of revolution passing through two circles whose relative positions are supposed to be given as indicated in the figure.</p>
