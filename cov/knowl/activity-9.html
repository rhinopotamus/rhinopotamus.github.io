<p>Whenever you encounter a new definition in a math textbook, it's a good idea to dig in and explore. Here are some questions that will be helpful in your exploration. Not every question applies to every situation, and there are certainly other questions you might consider asking.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>What are the important parts of this definition?</p></li>
<li><p>Can you draw a picture or diagram to help you understand this definition?</p></li>
<li><p>What's an example of something that satisfies this definition? What's a non-example? (The next paragraph will be helpful, but try to think of other examples besides those given in the book.)</p></li>
<li><p>If you're lucky enough to be reading a definition where some examples are immediately given, explore these examples. Draw pictures of the examples, and understand why they are examples. (Same deal for non-examples, if any.)</p></li>
