<p>We have seen in <a href="sec-shortest-arc.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.1: The shortest arc joining two points">SectionÂ 2.1</a> that necessary conditions on the shortest arc may be deduced by comparing it with other admissible arcs of special types, but that a particular line can be proved to be actually the shortest only by comparing it with all of the admissible arcs joining the same two end-points. The sufficiency proof of this section is valid not only for the arcs which we have named admissible but also for arcs with equations in the parametric form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
x=(t),\quad y=y(t) \quad (t_3 \leq t \leq t_5).\tag{2.6.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">We suppose always that the functions \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) are continuous, and that the interval \([t_3, t_5]\) can be subdivided into one or more parts on each of which \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) have continuous derivatives such that \((x')^2+(y')^2 \neq 0\text{.}\) The curve represented is then continuous and has a continuously turning tangent except possibly at a finite number of corners. A much larger variety of curves can be represented by such parametric equations than by an equation of the form \(y=y(x)\) because the parametric representation lays no restriction upon the slope of the curve or the number of points of the curve which may lie upon a single ordinate, while for an admissible arc \(y=y(x)\) the slope must always be finite and the number of points on each ordinate at most one.</p>
