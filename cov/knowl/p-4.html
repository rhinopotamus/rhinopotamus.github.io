<p>Among the earliest problems which attracted the attention of students of the calculus were those which require the determination of a maximum or a minimum. Fermat had devised as early as 1629 a procedure applicable to such problems, depending upon principles which in essence, though not in notation, were those of the modern differential calculus. Somewhat nearer to the type of reasoning now in common use are the methods which Newton and Leibniz applied to the determination of maxima and minima, methods which are also characteristic of their two conceptions of the fundamental principles of the differential calculus. Newton argued, in a paper written in 1671 but first published in 1736, that a variable is increasing when its rate of change is positive, and decreasing when its rate is negative, so that at a maximum or a minimum the rate must be zero. Leibniz, on the other hand, in a paper which he published in 1684, conceived the problem geometrically. At a maximum or a minimum point of a curve the tangent must be horizontal and the slope of the tangent zero.</p>
