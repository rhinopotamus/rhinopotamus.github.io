<p>At the present time our mathematics is usually less emotionally expressed, but in thought at least we can share the pleasure of the brothers in their interesting discovery. It is clear when we think intuitively about the brachistochrone, that the straight line could hardly have been expected to be the curve of quickest descent because it is evident that a particle should fall more rapidly on a curve which begins more steeply and imparts a higher velocity at the beginning of the fall. But just what degree of initial steepness is desirable in order to avoid too gradual a slope near the end of the fall could hardly have been foreseen.</p>
