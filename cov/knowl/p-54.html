<p>The idea of <em class="emphasis">smoothness</em>, which generalizes differentiability, is one that comes up a lot in analysis. We can categorize functions into several different <em class="emphasis">differentiability classes</em> based on how many continuous derivatives they have over some domain.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The first two classes are called \(C^0\) and \(C^1\text{.}\) \(C^0\) consists of all the <em class="emphasis">continuous</em> functions, and \(C^1\) is the class of <em class="emphasis">differentiable</em> functions whose derivative is continuous. Give an example of a function in \(C^0\) that isn't in \(C^1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>You may have noticed that in the definition of admissible functions above, we're allowing some cusps, as long as the function is <em class="emphasis">mostly</em> differentiable. This condition is more commonly referred to as being <em class="emphasis">piecewise differentiable</em> or <em class="emphasis">piecewise \(C^1\)</em>. Give an example of a function that's <em class="emphasis">not</em> in \(C^1\text{,}\) but <em class="emphasis">is</em> piecewise \(C^1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The very nicest functions (and, tbh, most of the ones we care about in everyday life) have infintely many derivatives. These are called <em class="emphasis">smooth</em> functions, and they belong to the class \(C^\infty\text{.}\) Give three examples of functions in \(C^\infty\text{.}\)</p></li>
