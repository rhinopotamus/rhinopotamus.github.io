<p>It will be proved that the Goldschmidt discontinuous solution, like the minimizing catenary described above, always generates a smaller surface of revolution than those generated by other curves joining its end-points and lying in a sufficiently small neighborhood of it. When the point 2 is above the envelope \(G\) both the catenary solution and the discontinuous solution are present, and Dr. H. F. MacNeish showed in 1905 how one may distinguish the one of them which generates the smaller surface. Professor Mary E. Sinclair has proved that the smaller one is also smaller than the surfaces of revolution generated by all other curves of a very general type joining the points 1 and 2. The methods of proving these statements in the following pages are somewhat different from the ones used by these writers, but the results established are identical with theirs.</p>
