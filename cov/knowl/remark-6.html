<p>What's going on here is we're broadening our class of admissible arcs to include not just the graphs of <em class="emphasis">functions</em> of the form \(y=y(x)\text{,}\) which must in particular pass the vertical line test, but also parametrically-defined curves. (You might know these as "space curves" or "<a class="external" href="https://activecalculus.org/multi/S-9-6-Vector-Valued-Functions.html" target="_blank">vector-valued functions</a>.") We're still going to insist that they are piecewise smooth in the sense of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/remark-admissible.html" title="Remark 2.1.2: Admissible arcs">RemarkÂ 2.1.2</a> from earlier.</p>
<p>The condition that \((x')^2+(y')^2 \neq 0\) just says that the tangent vector is never zero. That is, if a point is traversing the curve according to the equations given, it never just <em class="emphasis">stops</em> along the way. This isn't much of a concession; given any graph you'd want to draw, you can always find a way to parameterize it so that the point never has to stop.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-field.html#remark-6">in-context</a></span>
