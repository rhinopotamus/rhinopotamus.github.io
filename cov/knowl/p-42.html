<p>At the close of his paper James invited mathematicians in general to consider a much more difficult problem of the calculus of variations which he had devised, and he offered to John in particular a money prize of fifty ducats for a satisfactory solution. As it turned out, however, the ducats were saved, for although John claimed to have done so he did not as a matter of fact succeed in his attacks upon the problem, and after a rather bitter discussion which dragged on for a number of years James finally published his own solution in 1701. The two papers of 1697 and 1701 of James Bernoulli were the starting-point for the researches of Euler (1707-83), a native of Basle and pupil of John Bernoulli, one of the greatest of the world's mathematicians. It is to Euler that we owe the first important result in the modern theory of the calculus of variations, as we shall see in later chapters.</p>
