<p>It was remarked above that the earliest problems of the calculus of variations were not by any means the simplest. In his Principia (1686) Newton states without proof certain conditions which must be satisfied by a surface of revolution which is so formed that it will encounter a minimum resistance when moved in the direction of its axis through a resisting medium. A particular case of the problem of finding such a surface is the well-known one of determining the form of a projectile which for a specified initial velocity will give the longest range. In practical ballistics it turns out that one of the most difficult parts of the investigation of this question lies in the experimental determination of the retardation law for bodies moving in the air at high rates of speed. Newton assumed a relatively simple law of resistance for bodies moving in a resisting medium which does not agree well with our experience with bodies moving in the air, but on the basis of which he was able to find a condition characterizing the meridian curves of the surfaces of revolution which encounter minimum resistance. From a letter written by Newton to Professor David Gregory, probably in 1694, Bolza has reconstructed in most interesting fashion the arguments which Newton used in attaining his results.</p>
