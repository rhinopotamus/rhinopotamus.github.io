<p>As we have already noted in <a href="sec-two-problems.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.3: Two problems of the calculus of variations which may be simply formulated">Section 1.3</a>, the integral which we shall have to minimize for the problem of determining a surface of revolution of minimum area is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
I=\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(y, y')\,dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(f(y, y')\) now has the value</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
f(y, y') = y\sqrt{1+(y')^2}.\tag{4.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The curves to be studied for this problem must all lie in the upper half-plane \(y\geq 0\) since on an arc with portions below the \(x\)-axis the value of the integral \(I\) is the difference of the areas generated by the segments above and the segments below the axis, while we are wishing to consider the sum of those areas. If an arc has segments below the \(x\)-axis it may always be replaced by one above the axis which will generate the same surface, as is clear from <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-4-26.html" title="Figure 4.2.1">Figure 4.2.1</a>. Besides the restriction \(y\geq 0\) our curves \(y=y(x)\) we shall, as in the two preceding examples, assume that all the curves \(y=y(x)\) considered are continuous and have tangents which turn continuously except possibly at a finite number of corners. Let us call curves of this sort in the upper half-plane <dfn class="terminology">admissible curves</dfn>. <aside class="aside aside-like">That is, we're assuming \(y(x)\) is piecewise \(C^1\text{.}\)</aside> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="./images/fig-4-26.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Any portion of the curve below the x-axis may be reflected over the x-axis without changing the area of the surface of revolution."></div>
