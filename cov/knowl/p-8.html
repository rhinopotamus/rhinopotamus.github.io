<p>Here's an example that will help you think about this: Let's consider the relationship between squares and rectangles.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If we knew a shape was a square, we would definitely know it was a rectangle -- that is, "the shape is a square" is enough information to let you conclude that "the shape is a rectangle". So, "square" is <em class="emphasis">sufficient</em> for "rectangle".</p></li>
<li><p>If we knew the shape was a rectangle, we couldn't a priori be sure that it was a square, because there are rectangles that aren't squares. So, "rectangle" is <em class="emphasis">not</em> sufficient for "square".</p></li>
<li><p>However, if the shape <em class="emphasis">wasn't</em> a rectangle, then it definitely wouldn't be a square. Therefore, "rectangle" is <em class="emphasis">necessary</em> for "square".</p></li>
<li><p>But the opposite isn't true. If the shape wasn't a square, it might still be a rectangle. (It might also be a triangle or a hexagon or whatever, of course.) So "square" is <em class="emphasis">not</em> necessary for "rectangle".</p></li>
</ul>
