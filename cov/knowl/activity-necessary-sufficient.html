<p>As the book is about to say, for the problem of determining a minimum of a function, "it will be noted that the conditions just stated as necessary for a minimum are not identical with those which are sufficient."</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>What's the difference between the necessary condition and the sufficient condition? I claim that one condition is "stronger" in some sense; which is it?</p></li>
<li><p>If the conditions \(f'(a) = 0, \, f''(a) \geq 0\) are, as claimed, necessary but not sufficient for \(f(a)\) to be a minimum, then there must be some function where those conditions hold but you don't have a minimum. Give me an example of such a function.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a sentence or two explaining why the necessary condition isn't sufficient, and how we have to "strengthen" it a little to get a sufficient condition.</p></li>
