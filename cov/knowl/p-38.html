<p>Newton's problem in analytical form is then that of determining among all the arcs \(y = y(x)\) joining two given points 1 and 2 one which makes this integral a minimum. We could equally well of course ask to determine the curve so that the resistance should be a maximum. If the law of resistance of Newton is replaced by another the methods which we now know of attacking the problem will still be applicable, though the results may be different, as a number of writers have shown.</p>
