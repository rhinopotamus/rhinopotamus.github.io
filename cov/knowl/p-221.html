<p>The problem of determining a surface of revolution of minimum area, like the brachistochrone problem, was one of the earliest considered by students of the calculus of variations, and it is one of those which have been most thoroughly studied. It is in many respects the most satisfactory illustration which we have of the principles of the general theory of the calculus of variations in the plane. In spite of the fact that it was proposed early in the seventeenth century and has been restudied at frequent intervals since that time, one finds nevertheless that new results of interest and importance concerning it have been found in very recent years.</p>
