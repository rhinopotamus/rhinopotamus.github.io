<p>The only discussions of the problem which were published in full in response to John Bernoulli's invitation were those of the Bernoulli brothers themselves,3 in May, 1697, and they are in many respects characteristic of their authors. John's paper is to this day most elegant and satisfactory reading. He saw that the curve of quickest descent is identical with the path of a ray of light in a medium with a suitably selected variable index of refraction, and a known property of such paths enabled him to attain very quickly and easily a solution. His method can be applied, however, to only a restricted class of similar questions. The solution of James was more laborious, and to us much less attractive, since it was couched in the language of the relatively clumsy geometrical analysis which preceded the invention of the calculus and which was commonly used for some time thereafter. But his method was a more general one than that of his younger brother and was the first step in a long series of researches which has led to the theory of the calculus of variations as we know it today.</p>
