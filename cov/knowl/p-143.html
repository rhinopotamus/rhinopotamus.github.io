<p>When these results had been attained the eighteenth-century student was content with his progress, but we cannot be so easily satisfied because we know that in other problems of the calculus of variations further conditions on the minimizing arc are required which are quite different in character from those which have so far been described. Our doubts for this particular problem will be removed, however, by a so-called sufficiency proof which will definitely establish the fact that the time of descent from a given point 1 to a given point 2 on a suitably chosen cycloid is shorter than that on every other curve joining those two points. The method used is again that of Weierstrass, a special case of which we have already considered in <a href="sec-field.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.6: The notion of a field and a second sufficiency proof">SectionÂ 2.6</a> of the last chapter. The argument there given and the one which we shall see in the case of the brachistochrone are excellent illustrations of the type of proof which is effective for more general problems of the calculus of variations.</p>
