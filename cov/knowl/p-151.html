<p>The vertical force of gravity acting upon \(P\) is the product of the mass \(m\) by the gravitational acceleration \(g\text{,}\) and the only force acting upon \(P\) in the direction of the tangent line to the curve is the projection \(mg \sin \tau\) of this vertical gravitational force upon that line. But the force along the tangent may also be computed as the product \(m \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}\) of the mass of the particle by its acceleration along the curve. Equating these two values we find the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} = g \sin \tau = g \frac{dy}{ds},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">in which a common factor \(m\) has been discarded and use has been made of the well-known calculus formula \(\sin \tau = \frac{dy}{ds}\text{.}\)</p>
