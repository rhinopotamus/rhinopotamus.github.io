<p>Admissible curves of the form given in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-variation.html" title="Equation 2.2.1">(2.2.1)</a> are called by other authors <dfn class="terminology">variations</dfn> -- hence, the "calculus of variations". Think of them as starting with \(y(x)\) and "wiggling" it by \(\eta(x)\text{.}\) So, I'm going to define a <dfn class="terminology">wiggle</dfn> as an admissible function \(\eta(x)\) that satisfies the conditions \(\eta(x_1) = \eta(x_2) = 0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We insist that \(\eta(x_1) = \eta(x_2) = 0\) so that the starting and ending points don't get wiggled away from where they're supposed to be, so that a variation is some other admissible arc joining points 1 and 2. You can "scale up" the amount of wiggle by multiplying \(\eta(x)\) by some constant \(a\text{;}\) note in particular that when \(a=0\text{,}\) there's zero wiggle, and so the variation \(y(x)+a \eta(x)\) is just the original function \(y(x)\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-first-necessary.html#remark-var-wiggle">in-context</a></span>
