<p>To prove the first of these statements we may consider the curve \(C_{35}\) shown in the field of \(F\) of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-5.html" title="Figure 2.5.1">FigureÂ 2.5.1</a>. Through every point \((x, y)\) of this curve there passes, by hypothesis, a straight line of the field \(F\) intersecting \(D\text{,}\) and the formula <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-8.html" title="Equation 2.5.3">(2.5.3)</a>, applied to the one-parameter family of straight-line segments so determined by the points of \(C_{35}\text{,}\) gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
I^{*}\left(C_{35}\right)=I^{*}\left(D_{46}\right)-I\left(E_{56}\right)+I\left(E_{34}\right).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The values of the terms on the right are completely determined when the points 3 and 5 in the field are given, and are entirely independent of the form of the curve \(C_{35}\) joining these two points. This shows that the value \(I^*(C_{35})\) is the same for all arcs \(C_{35}\) in the field joining the same two end-points, as stated in the theorem.</p>
