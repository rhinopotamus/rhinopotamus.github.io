<p>At every point \((x, y)\) of a field \(F\) the straight line of the field has a slope \(p(x, y)\text{,}\) the function so defined being called the slope-function of the field. The integral \(I^*\) (from equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-i-star.html" title="Equation 2.5.2">(2.5.2)</a>) with this slope-function in place of \(p\) in its integrand has a definite value along every arc \(C_{35}\) in the field having equations of the form <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-11.html" title="Equation 2.6.1">(2.6.1)</a>, as we have seen on page 25. We can prove with the help of the formulas of the last section that the integral \(I^*\) associated in this way with a field has the two following useful properties: <article class="theorem theorem-like"><h6 class="heading">

<li><p>The values of \(I^*\) are the same along all curves \(C_{35}\) in the field F having the same end-points 3 and 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Furthermore along each segment of one of the straight lines of the field the value of \(I^*\) is equal to the length of the segment.</p></li>
