<p>The property just deduced for the shortest arc has so far only been proved to be necessary for a minimum. We have not yet demonstrated conclusively that the straight-line segment \(E_{12}\) joining 1 and 2 is actually shorter than every other admissible arc joining these points. In order to actually establish this fact let us now use \(\eta(x)\) to denote the increment which must be added to the ordinate <a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> of \(E_{12}\) at the value \(x\) in order to get the ordinate of an arbitrarily selected admissible arc \(C_{12}\) joining 1 with 2, so that the equation of \(C_{12}\) will be <aside class="aside aside-like">In other words, \(\eta(x)\) is the wiggle between \(E_{12}\) and \(C_{12}\text{.}\)</aside></p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y=y(x)+\eta(x) \quad (x_1\leq x \leq x_2).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation"> The difference between the lengths of \(C_{12}\) and \(E_{12}\) can now be expressed with the help of Taylor's formula in the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
I\left(C_{12}\right)-I\left(E_{12}\right) \amp= \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{1}}\left\{f\left(y^{\prime}+\eta^{\prime}\right)-f\left(y^{\prime}\right)\right\}\, dx \\
\amp=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f_{y^{\prime}} \eta^{\prime} d x+\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f_{y^{\prime} y^{\prime}}\left(y^{\prime}+\theta \eta^{\prime}\right) (\eta')^2\, dx 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(I(C_{12})\) and \(I(E_{12})\) are the values of the integral \(I\) along the two arcs; \(f_{y'y'}\) is the second derivative of the function \(f\) with respect to \(y'\text{;}\) and \(\theta\) is the value between 0 and 1 introduced by Taylor's formula. The next to last integral vanishes since \(f_{y'}\) is a constant along \(E_{12}\) and since the difference \(\eta(x)\) of the ordinates of two arcs \(C_{12}\) and \(E_{12}\) with the same end-points must vanish at \(x_1\) and \(x_2\text{.}\) Furthermore the last integral is never negative since the second derivative</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f_{y'y'} = \frac{1}{\left(1+\left(y'\right)^2\right)^{3/2}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">is always positive. We see therefore that \(I(C_{12})-I(E_{12})\) is greater than zero unless \(\eta'(x)\) vanishes identically, in which case ri(x) itself would have everywhere the constant value zero which it has at \(x_1\) and \(x_2\text{,}\) and \(C_{12}\) would coincide with \(E_{12}\text{.}\)</p>
