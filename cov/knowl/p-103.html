<p>Now we just have to think hard about \(\xi\text{,}\) which is supposed to be somewhere between \(x\) and \(a\text{.}\) In our case, that's somewhere between \(y'+\eta'\) and \(y'\text{.}\) The book is about to say that \(\xi = y'+\theta\cdot\eta'\text{,}\) where \(\theta\) is some number between 0 and 1. Why does this make sense?</p>
