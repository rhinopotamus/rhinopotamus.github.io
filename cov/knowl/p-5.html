<p>At the present time we know well that from a purely analytical standpoint these two methods are identical. The derivative</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}\tag{1.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">of a function \(f(x)\) represents both the rate of change of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) and the slope of the tangent at a point on the graph of \(f(x)\text{.}\) For in the first place the fraction in the second member of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-diffq.html" title="Equation 1.2.1">(1.2.1)</a> is the average rate of change of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) on the interval from \(x\) to \(x + \Delta x\text{,}\) and its limit as the interval is shortened is therefore rightly called the rate of change of \(f(x)\) at the initial value \(x\) of the interval. In the second place this same quotient is the slope of the secant \(PQ\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-1-1.html" title="Figure 1.2.1">FigureÂ 1.2.1</a>, and its limit is the slope of the tangent at \(P\text{.}\) Thus by the reasoning of either Newton or Leibnitz we know that the maxima and minima of \(f(x)\) occur at the values of \(x\) where the derivative \(f'(x)\) is zero.</p>
