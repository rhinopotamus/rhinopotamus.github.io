<p>It was not easy for the seventeenth-century mathe matician to deduce this simple criterion that the derivative \(f'(x)\) must vanish at a maximum or a minimum of \(f(x)\text{.}\) He was immersed in the study of special problems rather than general theories, and had no well-established limiting processes or calculus notations to assist him. It was still more difficult for him to advance one step farther to the realization of the significance of the second derivative \(f''(x)\) in distinguishing between maximum and minimum values. Leibniz in his paper of 1684 was the first to give the criterion. In present-day parlance we say that \(f'(a) = 0, \, f''(a) \geq 0\) are necessary conditions for the value \(f(a)\) to be a minimum, while the conditions \(f'(a) = 0, \, f''(a) \gt 0\) are sufficient to insure a minimum. For a maximum the inequality signs must be changed in sense.</p>
