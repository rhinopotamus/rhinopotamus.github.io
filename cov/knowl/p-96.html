<p>The property just deduced for the shortest arc has so far only been proved to be necessary for a minimum. We have not yet demonstrated conclusively that the straight-line segment \(E_{12}\) joining 1 and 2 is actually shorter than every other admissible arc joining these points. In order to actually establish this fact let us now use \(\eta(x)\) to denote the increment which must be added to the ordinate <a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> of \(E_{12}\) at the value \(x\) in order to get the ordinate of an arbitrarily selected admissible arc \(C_{12}\) joining 1 with 2, so that the equation of \(C_{12}\) will be <aside class="aside aside-like">In other words, \(C_{12}\) is a wiggle of \(E_{12}\text{,}\) and \(\eta(x)\) is the variation between \(E_{12}\) and \(C_{12}\text{.}\)</aside></p>
