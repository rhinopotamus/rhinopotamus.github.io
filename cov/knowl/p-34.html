<p>In order to phrase this problem analytically let the common axis of the two circles be taken as the \(x\)-axis, and let the points where the circles intersect an \(xy\)-plane through that axis be 1 and 2. If the meridian curve of the surface in the \(xy\)-plane has an equation \(y=y(x)\) then the calculus formula for the area of the surface is \(2\pi\) times the value of the integral <aside class="aside aside-like">Kudos to Jordan Contreras for spotting a typo in this equation; the \(y\) outside the radical was missing.</aside></p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
I=\int_{x_1}^{x_2} y \sqrt{1+(y')^2}\,dx. 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The problem of determining the form of the soap film surface between the two circles is analytically that of finding in the class of arcs \(y=y(x)\) whose ends are at the points 1 and 2 one which minimizes the last-written integral \(I\text{.}\)</p>
