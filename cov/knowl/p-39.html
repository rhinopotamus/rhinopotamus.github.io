<p>Newton's problem, published in the Principia in 1686, lay apparently unnoticed for more than a decade before a new interest aroused by a second and more famous problem of the calculus of variations caused it to be studied again. It is not surprising that this happened because Newton's description of his results is very informal and concise. He gave no hint of a larger class of similar questions, and no suggestion of a method of solution which might have been applicable to such a class. To discover the beginnings of active research in the calculus of variations we must turn therefore to other writers. In the period which followed the discovery and publication of the calculus methods of Newton and Leibnitz two of the most prominent and successful researchers in the new analysis were the Swiss mathematicians James Bernoulli (1654-1705), professor of mathematics at the University of Basle, and his brother John (1667-1748). The younger brother was a student of the elder, and among those students he was in later years by far the most distinguished on account of his varied and successful researches. He studied with James until the year 1690 when he forsook Basle for travel and the study of mathematics in France. Shortly after his return he accepted in 1695 a professorship at the University of Groningen, and in 1705, upon the death of James Bernoulli, he returned to Basle to spend the remainder of his life as professor of mathematics in his native city. In the years just preceding 1695 a rivalry sprang up between the two brothers the reason for which is not well understood. It was at times amusingly undignified, and from the scientific standpoint unjustifiable, since both brothers were with somewhat different temperaments remarkably able and worthy of respect. Whatever may have been the cause of their dissension it is at any rate true that the friction between them gave an unusual impetus and zest to the beginnings of the calculus of variations. In June, 1696, John Bernoulli proposed his now famous brachistochrone problem, and publicly incited the mathematicians of the world to give it their consideration, according to a custom which was common at the time. We know that the problem aroused great interest and that Newton, Leibniz, and l'Hospital (1661-1704), besides the brothers Bernoulli, found the correct solution.</p>
