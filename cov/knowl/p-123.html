<p>The mathematician who first made satisfactory sufficiency proofs in the calculus of variations was <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Weierstrass" target="_blank">Weierstrass</a>, and the ingenious device which he used in his proofs is called a field. <aside class="aside aside-like">This is definitely not the same kind of field we study in abstract algebra.</aside> For the problems which we are considering in this chapter a field \(F\) is a region of the \(xy\)-plane with which there is associated a one-parameter family of straight-line segments all of which intersect a fixed curve \(D\text{,}\) and which have the further property that through each point \((x, y)\) of \(F\) there passes one and but one of the segments. The curve \(D\) may be either inside the field, or outside as illustrated in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-5.html" title="Figure 2.5.1">FigureÂ 2.5.1</a>, and as a special case it may degenerate into a single fixed point.</p>
