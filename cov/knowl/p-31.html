<p>Let it be granted that a particular admissible arc \(E_{12}\) with the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y=y(x)\quad (x_1\leq x\leq x_2)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">furnishes the solution of our problem, and let us then seek to find the properties which distinguish it from the other admissible arcs joining points 1 and 2. If we select arbitrarily an admissible function \(\eta(x)\) satisfying the conditions \(\eta(x_1) = \eta(x_2) = 0\text{,}\) the equation</p>

\begin{equation}
y=y(x)+a \eta(x)\quad (x_1\leq x\leq x_2),\tag{2.2.1}

<p>Admissible curves of the form given in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-variation.html" title="Equation 2.2.1">(2.2.1)</a> are called by other authors <dfn class="terminology">variations</dfn> -- hence, the "calculus of variations". Think of them as starting with \(y(x)\) and "wiggling" it by \(\eta(x)\text{.}\) Then you can "scale up" the amount of wiggle by multiplying \(\eta(x)\) by some constant \(a\text{.}\) We insist that \(\eta(x_1) = \eta(x_2) = 0\) so that the starting and ending points don't get wiggled away from where they're supposed to be.</p></aside> involving the arbitrary constant \(a\text{,}\) represents a one-parameter family of curves which includes the arc \(E_{12}\) for the special value \(a=0\text{,}\) and all of the curves of the family pass through the end-points 1 and 2 of \(E_{12}\text{.}\) The value of the integral \(I\) taken along an arc of the family depends upon the value of \(a\) and may be represented by the symbol</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
I(a)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(y'+a \eta')\, dx.\tag{2.2.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">Along the initial arc \(E_{12}\) the integral has the value \(I(0)\text{,}\) and if this is to be a minimum when compared with the values of the integral along all other admissible arcs joining 1 with 2 it must in particular be a minimum when compared with the values \(I(a)\) along the arcs of the family <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-variation.html" title="Equation 2.2.1">(2.2.1)</a>.  Hence according to the criterion for a minimum of a function given on page 4 of the last chapter we must have \(I'(0) = 0\text{.}\)</p>
