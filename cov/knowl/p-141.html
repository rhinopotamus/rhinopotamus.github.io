<p>The first step which will be undertaken in the discussion of the problem in the following pages is the proof that a brachistochrone curve joining two given points must be a cycloid. We are familiar with the cycloid as the arched locus of a point on the rim of a wheel which rolls on a horizontal line, as shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-11.html" title="Figure 3.1.1">FigureÂ 3.1.1</a>. It turns out that the brachistochrone must consist of a portion of one of the arches turned upside down, and the line on the under side of which the circle rolls must be located at just the proper height above the given initial point of fall.</p>
