<p>The results which have so far been described evidently leave us in some doubt as to what happens when the point 2 lies on or below the envelope \(G\text{.}\) When 2 is on \(G\text{,}\) Jacobi's condition says that the unique catenary arc joining 1 with 2 cannot possibly furnish a minimum surface of revolution, and when 2 is below \(G\) there is no catenary of the family <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-4-1.html" title="Equation 4.1.1">(4.1.1)</a> whatsoever joining 1 with 2. When 2 is on or below \(G\) there is in fact no curve represented by an equation of the form \(y=y(x)\) which generates a minimum surface of revolution. We shall see that the minimum surface is in this case furnished by the broken line consisting of the two ordinates of the points 1 and 2 and the segment of the \(x\)-axis between them. It is called the Goldschmidt discontinuous solution of the problem, after the man who first discovered it in 1831, discontinuous because its tangent turns discontinuously at its two corners on the \(x\)-axis.</p>
