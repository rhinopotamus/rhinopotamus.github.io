<p>The point 3 where one of the catenaries \(E\) touches the envelope \(G\text{,}\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-4-25.html" title="Figure 4.1.3">FigureÂ 4.1.3</a>, is called the point conjugate to 1 on \(E\text{.}\) We shall see in a later section that if 4 is a second such contact point on the envelope \(G\text{,}\) as shown in the figure, then the surface of revolution generated by the composite arc \(E_{14}+G_{43}\) is always equal to that generated by \(E_{13}\text{.}\) This is a very interesting analogue of the string property of the evolute of a curve, and is another instance of the envelope theorem which was justified by Darboux, Zermelo, and Kneser. By means of it we shall be able to prove Jacobi's necessary condition which says that a catenary arc \(E_{132}\) having on it a point 3 conjugate to 1 can never furnish a surface of revolution of minimum area. As we have hitherto seen, the problems of the two preceding chapters required no application of Jacobi's necessary condition for the case when the two end-points of the minimizing curve were given in advance. It was for this case, however, that Jacobi originally stated his remarkable condition which distinguishes the calculus of variations in such a striking way from the ordinary theory of maxima and minima of functions of one or more variables.</p>
