<p>It will be noted that the conditions just stated as necessary for a minimum are not identical with those which are sufficient. We shall see in Chapter V that a similar undesirable and much more baffling discrepancy occurs in the calculus of variations. For the simple problem of minimizing a function \(f(x)\) the doubtful intermediate case when \(f'(a)\) and \(f''(a)\) are both zero was discussed by Maclaurin (1698-1746) who showed how higher derivatives may be used to obtain criteria which are both necessary and sufficient. For the calculus of variations the corresponding problem offers great difficulty and has never been completely solved.</p>
