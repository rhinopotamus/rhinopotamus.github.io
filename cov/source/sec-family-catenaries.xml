<section xml:id="sec-family-catenaries" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
  <title>The one-parameter family of catenaries through a point</title>
  <p>Our next step is to determine the number and the character of the catenaries <xref ref="eqn-4-5"/> which pass through the two given points 1 and 2. The plan is to find the equation of the one-parameter family of these catenaries passing through the point 1, and then to determine how many of them pass through the second point 2. The equation
  <m>y_1 = b \cosh \frac{x_1-a}{b}</m>
  is the condition that the catenary <xref ref="eqn-4-5"/> shall pass through the point 1. It is satisfied, as one readily verifies, when <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are expressed in terms of a new parameter <m>\alpha</m> in the form
  <men xml:id="eqn-4-6">
    a=x_{1}-y_{1} \frac{\alpha}{\cosh \alpha}, \quad b=\frac{y_{1}}{\cosh \alpha},
  </men>
  and the family of catenaries through the point 1 is therefore
  <men xml:id="eqn-4-7">
    y=\frac{y_{1}}{\cosh\alpha} \cosh\left(\alpha+\frac{x-x_{1}}{y_{1}} \cosh \alpha \right)=y(x, \alpha),
  </men>
  where <m>y(x, \alpha)</m> is simply a convenient symbol for the more complicated expression preceding it.  
  </p>
  <p>
    In deducing the properties of the one-parameter family of catenaries through the point 1, we shall need the first and second derivatives with respect to <m>x</m> and <m>\alpha</m> of the function <m>y(x, \alpha)</m> defined in <xref ref="eqn-4-7"/>. Derivatives with respect to <m>x</m> will be denoted by primes and with respect to <m>\alpha</m> by subscripts, while the subscript 1 will be used to designate values of <m>x, y, y'</m> at the point 1. If we remember the formulas
    <me>
      \frac{d}{du} \cosh u = \sinh u, \quad \frac{d}{du} \sinh u = \cosh u
    </me>
    mentioned above, we find readily the values
    <mdn xml:id="eqn-4-8">
      <mrow> y  \amp= \frac{y_1}{\cosh \alpha} \cosh\left(\alpha + \frac{x - x_1}{y_1} \cosh \alpha \right) = y (x, \alpha) </mrow>
      <mrow> y' \amp= \sinh \left(\alpha + \frac{x-x_1}{y_1} \cosh\alpha\right), \quad y_1' = \sinh \alpha </mrow>
      <mrow> y_\alpha \amp= \frac{y' \cdot y_1'}{\cosh \alpha} \left(x - \frac{y}{y'} - x_1 + \frac{y_1}{y_1'}\right),  </mrow>
    </mdn>
    where in calculating the last derivative hyperbolic sines and cosines have been replaced except in one instance by their values in terms of <m>y, y', y_1 , y_1'</m> from the first three equations.
