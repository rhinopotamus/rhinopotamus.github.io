<p>The reasoning by means of which equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-3-11.html" title="Equation 3.3.6">(3.3.6)</a> has been derived is valid not only for the particular integrand function</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(y, y') = \sqrt{\frac{1+(y')^2}{y-\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">of the brachistochrone problem but also for an arbitrary function \(f(y, y')\) of the two variables \(y\) and \(y'\) which with its derivatives has suitable continuity properties. One can further verify readily that the proofs of equations <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-3-9.html" title="Equation 3.3.4">(3.3.4)</a> and <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-3-10.html" title="Equation 3.3.5">(3.3.5)</a> hold without alteration not only for this case but also for the still more general integral \(I\) to be studied in Chapter V for which the integrand is assumed to be a function \(f(x, y, y')\) of the three variables \(x, y, y'\text{.}\) It is evident, therefore, that the results of this section have great generality and that they may be applied to a wide variety of problems in the calculus of variations. <em class="alert">One should note that</em> equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-3-11.html" title="Equation 3.3.6">(3.3.6)</a> cannot be expected to hold when \(x\) occurs in the integrand function, since in the differentiations made to obtain it the function \(f\) was supposed to contain only the variables \(y\) and \(y'\text{.}\)</p>
