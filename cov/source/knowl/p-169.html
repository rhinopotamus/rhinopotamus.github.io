<p>In our study of the shortest-distance problems in the last chapter the arcs to be considered were taken in the form \(y=y(x) (x_1 \leq x \leq x_2)\) with \(y(x)\) continuous on the interval \(x_1 \leq x \leq x_2\text{,}\) and the interval could furthermore be subdivided into parts on each of which the derivative \(y'(x)\) is continuous. An <em class="emphasis">admissible arc</em> for the brachistochrone problem will always be understood to have these properties besides the additional one that it lies entirely in the half-plane \(y\gt a\text{.}\) For an admissible function, however, we retain always the definition given in <a href="sec-shortest-arc.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.1: The shortest arc joining two points">Section 2.1</a>. Our problem is then to find among the admissible arcs joining the points 1 and 2, one which minimizes the integral \(I\text{.}\)</p>
