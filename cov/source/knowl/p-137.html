<p>and the difference between the values of \(I\) along \(C_{12}\) and \(E_{12}\) is therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
I\left(C_{12}\right)-I\left(E_{12}\right)=\int_{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}(1-\cos \theta) \, ds \geq 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The equality sign can hold only if \(C_{12}\) coincides with \(E_{12}\text{.}\) For when the integral in the last equation is zero we must have \(\cos\theta = 1\) at every point of \(C_{12}\text{,}\) from which it follows that \(C_{12}\) is tangent at every point to a straight line of the field and satisfies the equation \(dy = p\, dx\text{.}\) Such a differential equation can have but one solution through the initial point 1 and that solution is \(E_{12}\text{.}\) We have proved therefore that the length \(I(C_{12})\) of \(C_{12}\) is always greater than that of \(E_{12}\) unless \(C_{12}\) is coincident with \(E_{12}\text{.}\)</p>
