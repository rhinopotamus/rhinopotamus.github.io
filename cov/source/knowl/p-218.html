<p>The fact that the curve of quickest descent must be a cycloid is the famous result discovered by James and John Bernoulli in 1697 and announced at approximately the same time by a number of other mathematicians. The cycloid and its remarkable properties had been the subject of much study in the seventeenth century. Huygens (1629-95) in particular had shown that the evolute of a cycloid \(CC'\) shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-3-14.html" title="Figure 3.5.2">Figure 3.5.2</a> is a second cycloid of exactly the same size situated in the position which is dotted in the figure, and further that the time of descent of a particle starting at rest at the point \(C\) and falling along the cycloid to the lowest point \(B\) is the same no matter what the position of the starting-point \(C\) on the cycloid arc may be. We know from the string property of an evolute, proved on page 32 of the last chapter, that if a pendulum of length \(4b\) is so suspended at \(A\) that the string is compelled to wrap itself around the dotted evolute, then the pendulum bob will oscillate on an arc \(CC'\) of the cycloid. From the isochronous property of Huygens it follows that the period of oscillation will be the same no matter how great or how small the amplitude of the oscillation from \(C\) to \(C'\) may be. This has been considered a very important discovery for the clockmaker, though one rarely finds apparatus on his mantel which is built upon this principle. <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="./images/fig-3-14.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="A cycloid and its evolute."></div>
