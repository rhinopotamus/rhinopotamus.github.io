<p>It is clear that an arc which minimizes one of the integrals <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-3-4.html" title="Equation 3.2.4">(3.2.4)</a> expressing \(T\) will also minimize that integral when the factor \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2g}}\) is omitted, and vice versa. Let us therefore use the notations</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
I=\int_{x_{2}}^{x_{3}} f\left(y, y^{\prime}\right) dx, \quad f\left(y, y^{\prime}\right)=\sqrt{\frac{1+(y')^2}{y-\alpha}}\tag{3.2.5}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">for our integral which we seek to minimize and its integrand. Since the value of the function \(f(y, y')\) is infinite when \(y = \alpha\) and imaginary when \(y\lt \alpha\) we must confine our curves to the portion of the plane which lies below the line \(y=\alpha\) in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-12.html" title="Figure 3.2.1">Figure 3.2.1</a>. This is not really a restriction of the problem since the equation \(v^2=\left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^2 = 2g(y-\alpha)\) deduced above shows that a particle started on a curve with the velocity \(v_1\) at the point 1 will always come to rest if it reaches the altitude \(y=\alpha\) on the curve, and it can never rise above that altitude. For the present we shall restrict our curves to lie in the half-plane \(y\gt \alpha\text{.}\) In a later section of this chapter we shall see what happens when curves are permitted which have points in common with the line \(y=\alpha\text{.}\)</p>
