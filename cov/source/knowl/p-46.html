<p>The integral <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-gen-form1.html" title="Equation 1.6.1">(1.6.1)</a> still does not include that of Newton's problem as a special case, though it is general enough to so include most of the classical special problems of the calculus of variations in the plane. It will be quite as easy for us, however, to consider an integral of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
I=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} f\left(x, y, y^{\prime}\right)\,dx\, ,\tag{1.6.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">having an integrand which is an arbitrary function of the three variables \(x, y, y'\text{,}\) as we shall do in Chapter V. Among all the arcs \(y=y(x)\) joining two given points 1 and 2 we shall seek one which minimizes the integral <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-gen-form.html" title="Equation 1.6.2">(1.6.2)</a>, This is a problem of sufficient generality to include all of those hitherto stated as special cases.</p>
