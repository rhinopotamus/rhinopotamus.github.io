<p>When one realizes the difficulty with which the late seventeenth-century school of mathematicians established the first fundamental principles of the calculus and their applications to such elementary problems in maxima and minima as the one which has just been described, it is remarkable that they should have conceived or attempted to solve with their relatively crude analytical machinery the far more difficult maximum and minimum problems of the calculus of variations which were at first proposed. It is an interesting fact that these early problems were not by any means the least complicated ones of the calculus of variations, and we shall do well therefore to introduce ourselves to the subject by looking first at two others which are easier to describe to one who has not already amused himself by browsing in this domain of mathematics.</p>
