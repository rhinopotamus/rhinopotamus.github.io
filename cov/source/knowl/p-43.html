<p>It is fair to say that the theory of the calculus of variations had its beginning in the interesting brachistochrone problem of John Bernoulli. One should not infer from this remark that no problems of the calculus of variations were known earlier, for we have seen already that Newton had proposed such a problem and described a characteristic property of its solution. Furthermore the brachistochrone problem itself was more or less definitely in the mind of Galileo (1564-1642) in 1630 and 1638 when he compared the time of fall of a particle along an arc of a vertical circle with those along polygons inscribed in the arc. He seems to conclude that the time of descent on a circular arc is shorter than the times on all other paths joining its endpoints, but his proof does not justify this result. Nowadays we know that the solution curve is neither a circle nor a straight line but a cycloid, as will be proved in Chapter III. A still older problem of the calculus of variations is the isoperimetric problem of the ancient Greeks described in <a href="sec-other-problems.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.7: Other problems of the calculus of variations">Section 1.7</a> below. None of these, however, could rightly be regarded as the starting-point of the theory of the calculus of variations, for in the early references to them there were no indications of other problems of similar type, or of methods of solution possessing generality of application.</p>
