<p>These and other properties of the cycloid were well known before the end of the seventeenth century. That the cycloid should also be the solution of the brachistochrone problem was regarded with wonder and admiration by the Bernoulli brothers. Somewhat freely translated the comment of John was "With justice we admire Huygens because he first discovered that a heavy particle falls on a cycloid in the same time always, no matter what the starting-point may be. But you will be petrified with astonishment when I say that exactly this same cycloid, the tautochrone of Huygens, is the brachistochrone which we are seeking." And with rhetorically sustained enthusiasm James remarks "Thus for this curve, which has been investigated by so many mathematicians that apparently nothing further concerning it could remain to be discovered, we find a new property, as it were an indication of its desire that no obligation might be incurred to future centuries but that it might attain the pinnacle of perfection at the end of the present one at whose beginning its birth was celebrated and among whose researches there have fallen to its lot the discovery of all of its mensurable properties and many other beautiful characteristics."</p>
