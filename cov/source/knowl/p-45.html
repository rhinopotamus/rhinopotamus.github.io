<p>John Bernoulli noted that the time of descent of a particle down a curve \(y=y(x)\text{,}\) and the time of passage of a ray along the same curve in a medium with the index of refraction \(n(x,y)=\frac{c}{\sqrt{y-a}}\text{,}\) are, except for a constant factor, given by the same integral <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-gen-form1.html" title="Equation 1.6.1">(1.6.1)</a> with this index substituted. He knew furthermore that when a ray of light passes from one medium to another the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction at the bounding surface are proportional to the indices of refraction in the two media, and by thinking of his medium as made up of very thin horizontal layers with different indices he was able to deduce the form of the curve of quickest descent.</p>
