<p>In the equation \(y=y(x)+a\eta(x)\) of the family of curves passing through the points 1 and 2 the function \(\eta(x)\) was entirely arbitrary except for the restrictions that it should be admissible and satisfy the relations \(\eta(x_1)=\eta(x_2)=0\text{,}\) and we have seen that the expression <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-iprime0.html" title="Equation 2.2.3">(2.2.3)</a> for \(I'(0)\) must vanish for every such family. The lemma of the preceding section is therefore applicable and it tells us that along the minimizing arc \(E_{12}\) an equation <aside class="aside aside-like">Take the derivative of the arc length formula \(\sqrt{1+(y')^2}\) with respect to \(y'\text{.}\)</aside></p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f_{y^{\prime}}=\frac{y^{\prime}}{\sqrt{1+\left(y'\right)^2}}=C
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">must hold, where \(C\) is a constant. If we solve this equation for \(y'\) we see that \(y'\) is also a constant along \(E_{12}\) and that the only possible minimizing arc is therefore a single straight-line segment without corners joining the point 1 with the point 2.</p>
