</h6>
<p>Admissible functions like \(\eta(x)\) as described in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-variation.html" title="Equation 2.2.1">(2.2.1)</a> are called by other authors <dfn class="terminology">variations</dfn> -- hence, the "calculus of variations". Think of starting with \(y(x)\) and "wiggling" it by \(\eta(x)\) -- I'm thus going to call anything that looks like \(y=y(x)+a \eta(x)\) a <em class="emphasis">wiggle</em> of \(y\text{.}\) That is, any member of this "one-parameter family of curves" is a wiggle of the original function \(y(x)\text{.}\)</p>
<p>We insist that \(\eta(x_1) = \eta(x_2) = 0\) so that the starting and ending points don't get wiggled away from where they're supposed to be, so that any other wiggle is some other admissible arc joining points 1 and 2. You can "scale up" the amount of wiggle by multiplying \(\eta(x)\) by some constant \(a\text{.}\) Note in particular that:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>For any constant \(a\text{,}\) the function \(a\cdot\eta(x)\) is just a vertical stretch of \(\eta(x)\) by a factor of \(a\text{,}\) and is therefore itself a variation.</p></li>
<li><p>When \(a=0\text{,}\) the amount of wiggle is 0, and so the wiggle \(y(x)+a \eta(x)\) is just the original function \(y(x)\text{.}\)</p></li>
