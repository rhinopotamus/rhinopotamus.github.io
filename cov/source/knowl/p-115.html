<p>We shall need frequently to integrate the expression in the second member of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-dI.html" title="Equation 2.5.1">(2.5.1)</a> along curves such as \(C\) and \(D\text{.}\) This is evidently justifiable along \(C\text{,}\) for example, since the slope \(p=(y_4-y_3)/(x_4-x_3)\) is a function of \(t\) and since the differentials \(dx, dy\) can be calculated in terms of \(t\) and \(dt\) from the equations of \(C\text{,}\) so that the expression takes the form of a function of \(t\) multiplied by \(dt\text{.}\) The integral \(I^*\) defined by the formula</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
I^* = \int \frac{dx+p\,dy}{\sqrt{1+p^{2}}}\tag{2.5.2}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">will also be well defined along an arbitrary curve \(C\) when \(p\) is a function of \(x\) and \(y\text{,}\) provided that we agree to calculate the value of \(I^*\) by substituting for \(x, y, dx, dy\) the expressions for these variables in terms of \(t\) and \(dt\) obtained from the parametric equations of \(C\text{.}\)</p>
