<p>The words "necessary" and "sufficient" are used a lot in mathematics, though they are perhaps a little old-fashioned. The statement "\(P\) is sufficient for \(Q\)" means "if \(P\) then \(Q\)", or \(P \to Q\text{.}\) The statement "\(P\) is necessary for \(Q\)" means "if \(Q\) then \(P\)", or \(Q\to P\text{.}\) If \(P\) is both necessary and sufficient for \(Q\text{,}\) then you're living in if-and-only-if land: that is, \(P\) and \(Q\) are logically equivalent, or \(P\leftrightarrow Q\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Here's an example that will help you think about this: Let's consider the relationship between squares and rectangles.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>If we knew a shape was a square, we would definitely know it was a rectangle -- that is, "the shape is a square" is enough information to let you conclude that "the shape is a rectangle". So, "square" is <em class="emphasis">sufficient</em> for "rectangle".</p></li>
<li><p>If we knew the shape was a rectangle, we couldn't a priori be sure that it was a square, because there are rectangles that aren't squares. So, "rectangle" is <em class="emphasis">not</em> sufficient for "square".</p></li>
<li><p>However, if the shape <em class="emphasis">wasn't</em> a rectangle, then it definitely wouldn't be a square. Therefore, "rectangle" is <em class="emphasis">necessary</em> for "square".</p></li>
<li><p>But the opposite isn't true. If the shape wasn't a square, it might still be a rectangle. (It might also be a triangle or a hexagon or whatever, of course.) So "square" is <em class="emphasis">not</em> necessary for "rectangle".</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Don't be worried if you have to think hard about this every time you see these words. I do too; I had to think really carefully while writing this whole remark. :)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-maxima-and-minima.html#remark-necessary-sufficient">in-context</a></span>
