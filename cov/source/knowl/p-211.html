<p>For the special case of the brachistochrone problem the integrand \(f(y, y')\) and its partial derivatives are readily found to be</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
f=\sqrt{\frac{1+(y')^2}{y-\alpha}}, \quad
f_{y}=-\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{1+(y')^2}{(y-a)^{3}}}, \quad
f_{y^{\prime}}=\frac{y^{\prime}}{\sqrt{(y-\alpha)\left(1+(y')^2\right)}}\tag{3.4.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">and the condition <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-3-9.html" title="Equation 3.3.4">(3.3.4)</a> of the preceding section, which must hold along every minimizing arc \(E_{12}\text{,}\) can therefore be expressed in the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{y^{\prime}}{\sqrt{1+(y')^2}}=\sqrt{y-\alpha}\left\{c-\frac{1}{2} \int_{x_{1}}^{x} \sqrt{\frac{1+(y')^2}{(y-\alpha)^{3}}}\,dx\right\}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">The second member of this equation, which we may denote by \(\phi(x)\text{,}\) is a continuous function of \(x\) since both \((y-\alpha)\) and the integral in it are continuous along \(E_{12}\text{.}\) By solving the equation for \(y'\) we find that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y'=\frac{\phi}{\sqrt{1-\phi^2}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">is also continuous. Turning again to the next to last equation with this result we see now that the second member \(\phi(x)\) of that equation has also a continuous derivative, since when \(y\) is continuous and has a continuous derivative the same is true of both \((y-\alpha)\) and the integral occurring in it. Hence \(y'\) in the last equation must have a continuous derivative and we find the following result:</p>
