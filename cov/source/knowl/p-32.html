<p>In the more elementary minimum problem of <a href="sec-maxima-and-minima.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Maxima and minima">Section 1.2</a> a function \(f(x)\) is given and a value \(x = a\) is sought for which the corresponding value \(f(a)\) is a minimum. In the shortest-distance problem the integral \(I\) takes the place of \(f(x)\text{,}\) and instead of a value \(x = a\) making \(f(a)\) a minimum we seek to find an arc \(E_{12}\) joining the points 1 and 2 which shall minimize \(I\text{.}\) The analogy between the two problems is more perspicuous if we think of the length \(I\) as a function \(I(E_{12})\) whose value is uniquely determined when the arc \(E_{12}\) is given, just as \(f(x)\) in the former case was a function of the variable \(x\text{.}\)</p>
