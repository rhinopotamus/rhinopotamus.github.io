<p>At this important stage there appeared upon the scene two men of extraordinary mathematical insight, Newton (1642-1727) in England, and Leibniz (1646-1716) in Germany, who from two somewhat different standpoints carried forward the theory and applications of the calculus with great strides. It is a mistake, though we often find it an easy convenience, to regard these two great thinkers as having invented the calculus out of a clear sky. Newton was in fact a close student of the work of Wallis, and a pupil of Barrow whom he succeeded as professor of mathematics at Cambridge, while we know that Leibniz visited Paris and London early in his career and that he there became acquainted with the most advanced mathematics of his day. No one could successfully contest the fact, however, that these two men were the most able spokesmen and investigators of the seventeenth-century school of mathematicians to which we owe the gradual evolution of the calculus.</p>
