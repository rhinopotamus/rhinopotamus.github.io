<p>The theory of the calculus of variations has been extensively developed but not so widely applied to special cases, very few of the particular problems having been exhaustively investigated. In the following Chapters II-IV three of the special problems mentioned in the preceding pages which have been studied in detail will be discussed, and in Chapter V some of the results for the more general problem formulated in Section 6 are collected, with a brief historical sketch of the progress of the theory from the time of the Bernoullis to the present.</p>
