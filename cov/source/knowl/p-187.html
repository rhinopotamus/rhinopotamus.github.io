<p>The equation <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-3-10.html" title="Equation 3.3.5">(3.3.5)</a> is the famous differential equation deduced by Euler in 1744 and called after him <dfn class="terminology">Euler's differential equation</dfn>. Its solutions have been named <dfn class="terminology">extremals</dfn> because they are the only curves which can give the integral \(I\) a maximum or a minimum, i.e., an extreme value. We shall in the following pages apply the term extremal only to those solutions \(y(x)\) which have continuously turning tangents and continuous second derivatives \(y''(x)\text{.}\) <aside class="aside aside-like">In more modern language, we're going to insist that \(y(x)\) is a function of class \(C^2\text{.}\)</aside></p>
