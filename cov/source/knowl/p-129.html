<p>The whole plane is a field when covered by a system of parallel lines, the curve \(D\) being in this case any straight line or curve which intersects all of the parallels. The plane with the exception of a single point 0 is a field when covered by the rays through 0, and 0 is a degenerate curve \(D\text{.}\) The tangents to a circle do not cover a field since through each point outside of the circle there pass two tangents, and through a point inside the circle there is none. If, however, we cut off half of each tangent at its contact point with the circle, leaving only a one-parameter family of half-rays all pointing in the same direction around the circle, then the exterior of the circle is a field simply covered by the family of half-rays.</p>
