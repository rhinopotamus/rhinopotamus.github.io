<p>With the exception of the integral in Newton's problem those which have been mentioned in the preceding sections all have the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
I=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} n(x, y) \sqrt{1+(y')^2}\, dx\, ,\tag{1.6.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">and we might propose to ourselves to find among the curves \(y=y(x)\) joining two given points one which minimizes this integral \(I\text{.}\) This problem also has a physical interpretation. For suppose that in a plane transparent medium the velocity of light varies from point to point, and that at an arbitrary point \((x, y)\) it has the value \(v(x, y)\text{.}\) The index of refraction at that point has by definition the value \(n(x, y) = \frac{c}{v(x,y)}\text{,}\) where \(c\) is a constant, and the time \(dt\) taken by a disturbance to travel along an arc of length \(ds\) through the point \((x, y)\) with the velocity \(v(x, y)\) is approximately</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
dt=\frac{ds}{v(x, y)}=\frac{1}{c} n(x, y) \sqrt{1+(y')^2}\,dx\, .
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">We see readily by an integration that the integral \(I\) is proportional to the time taken by a disturbance to traverse the arc \(y=y(x)\) joining the two given points 1 and 2. Now it has been verified physically that the path of a ray of light in a medium in which the velocity of light varies from point to point is always one on which the time-integral \(I\) is, for short arcs at least, a minimum, so that our problem of minimizing \(I\) is that of determining the paths of rays of light in a plane medium whose variable index of refraction is \(n(x, y)\text{.}\)</p>
