<p>In order to discuss intelligently the problem of the brachistochrone we should first deduce for ourselves the integral which represents the time required by a particle to fall under the action of gravity down an arbitrarily chosen curve joining two fixed points 1 and 2. It is agreed that the initial velocity \(v_1\) at the point 1 is given in advance, and that the particle is to fall without friction on the curve and without resistance in the surrounding medium. If the effects of friction or a resisting medium are to be taken into account the brachistochrone problem becomes a much more complicated one.</p>
