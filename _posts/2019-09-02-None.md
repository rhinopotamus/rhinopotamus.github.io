Dear Sister,

You don't know me. I owe you nothing.

I'm good at picking out corn
not because I ever worked on a farm as you supposed
(I didn't)
but because my mom showed me how to pick out good corn,
and I don't owe you that story.

I know you're going to post that picture and use it to congratulate yourself to all your faithful followers on Facebook. I don't agree with any of the things you're going to say as a caption of it.
