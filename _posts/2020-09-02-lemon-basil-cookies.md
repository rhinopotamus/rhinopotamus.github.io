Full credit for this recipe to my friend Lindsay Nielson. :)


Ingredients:


* 1 C sugar
* Zest of 2 lemons
* 10 T butter, softened
* 1 large egg
* 1 large egg yolk
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1 1/2 t pure lemon extract
* (Optional) 5 drops yellow food coloring
* 1 oz fresh basil leaves, finely minced
* 2 C flour
* 2 t baking powder
* 1/2 t salt


Directions:


1. Preheat oven to 375°. Rub the lemon zest into the sugar until it is evenly dispersed, then cream the butter and sugar together.
2. Add the eggs, lemon juice, and lemon extract (and food coloring, if using), mix thoroughly.
3. Stir in the basil.
4. Whisk the dry ingredients together and add to wet. Mix until just combined.
5. Drop dough in 1 1/2 Tbsp balls onto parchment, spaced 2 inches apart. Bake at 375° for 11-13 minutes, or until just golden around the edges.


Notes:


* I like a crispier cookie with some bite, so that's what my baking directions produce. If you like a softer cookie, bake at 350 for 9-10 minutes (just set in the middle).
* These cookies spread more than you think, so do space them out a good ways.
* If you want to do thumbprints, flour your thumb before every one, because the dough is pretty sticky.
