* I have tickets to a Gold Cup double-header in Utah on July 13 (USA vs. Cuba and Belize vs. Costa Rica)
* I'm planning my summer trip to Utah around this match and fully intend to plan it in such a way that I can go to an RSL game on either 7/3 or 7/20
* The USMNT is (rumored to be) playing a friendly against Guatemala at Qualcomm on July 5 and if tickets ever go on sale I'd probably buy tickets to that (and alter my Utah plans accordingly)
* Xolos and Club América are playing at Petco Park on July 6 and I'm totally thinking about buying tickets (Castillo! Corona! López Ojeda!)
* A bunch of us are going to watch the local semi-pro team play up in Black Mountain/PQ next Saturday
* I missed the Champions League final on Saturday so I avoided sports websites until I could find a replay online
* And then today I spent a bunch of time talking about it with my soccer friend at school
* Also today I spent like an hour watching RSL play against some minor-league team in the US Open Cup which is a domestic competition that nobody really cares about that much but it was soccer anyway
* I've been frequenting a sports bar/restaurant in PB specifically because they subscribed to the MLS TV packages, even though I think their food is overpriced
* The World Cup is coming up next year in Brazil and I'll basically be graduated and my friend was telling me how he's going to take out some student loan money so he and his family can go down and watch a match or two and this sounds like a kind of awesome idea

I regret nothing.
