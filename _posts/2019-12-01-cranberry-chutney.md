This is my adaptation of a family tradition [cranberry chutney](https://dinnertimeblues.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/cranberry-chutney/) that I always insist on making for Thanksgiving. More story after the recipe, because that's where stories belong.

**Ingredients**
* 2 oranges, zested, peeled, and chopped
* 1 chopped unpeeled apple
* 4 C cranberries (that's 1 standard package)
* 2 C sugar
* 1/2 C dried cherries or craisins (cherries are better but also more expensive)
* 1/4 C finely chopped walnuts or pecans
* 1 T white vinegar
* 1/2 t cinnamon (but c'mon, it's cinnamon, it's delicious, be generous)


**Method**
* Combine all ingredients in a saucepan, stir to combine.

* Heat on high with the lid on, stirring occasionally, until stuff starts boiling; then remove the lid and reduce heat to medium.

* Cook (somewhere between a simmer and a boil) until most of the cranberries have popped. The sauce will be noticeably thicker and darker, and you'll see cranberry seeds strewn about. Optional but highly recommended: grind some black pepper over the top.

* Let cool, then refrigerate. (It's probably cold outside!)

This recipe is a family heirloom that we originally found in a grocery store ad. It's good on turkey, obviously, and you should definitely put some in a sandwich with cream cheese and leftover turkey and grill it. However, it's also awesome on pork. Ladle some of this over a seared pork tenderloin in the slow cooker, or put some on your pork chops [when you move them to the oven](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-perfect-pork-chops-in-the-oven-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-194257), and you're gonna have a nice dinner. I also think it'd be delicious on some good vanilla ice cream.
