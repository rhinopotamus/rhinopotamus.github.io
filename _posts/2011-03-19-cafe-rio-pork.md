One of the things I really miss about Utah is the ready availability of Cafe Rio - the closest one to me is clear up in L.A. County. When I discovered [this recipe](http://www.favfamilyrecipes.com/2008/09/cafe-rio-sweet-pork.html), and made a few modifications of my own, it helped reduce the DT's to at least manageable levels.

Stuff you will need:
Pork shoulder (it shreds the best; some people also use Boston butt)
Several cans of Coke
Brown sugar
1 small onion
Garlic powder
1 can diced green chiles
1 can red enchilada sauce

If you've got time, put the pork in a zip-lock bag with enough Coke to cover and about 1/4 C of brown sugar and marinate it overnight.
Dump the pork in a slow cooker with the marinade (you can drain it if you really want to, but there's no real point), and add:
1 t or so (a goodly shake) of garlic powder (at least a teaspoon); 
2-3 T more brown sugar;
1/2 a small onion, diced (or more if you like onion);
and enough water or Coke to cover the pork. It's okay if some corners are sticking out.
Cook for 3-4 hours on high or 8 hours on low, so it shreds easily.
Pull the pork out and shred it; dump the cooking liquids (and all the little bits of onion) into a blender or food processor. (Again, you can drain it if you want, but I feel like you lose a lot of pork and onion flavor that way.) Into the blender add:
1/2 to 1 can diced green chiles;
3/4 to 1 can enchilada sauce; and
1/2 to 3/4 C brown sugar.
Blend until all the onion bits and green chiles are indistinguishable from the general delicious soupiness. Put the pork back in the slow cooker, add the sauce, and cook on low for at least another 2 hours. Serve on flour tortillas with cheese, long strips of Romaine lettuce, and optional cilantro and sour cream.
