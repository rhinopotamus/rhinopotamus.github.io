Here are three songs that I've been listening to a lot lately, and which remind me of each other. Two are new and one is old, and I'm pretty sure that the new ones are at least partially inspired by the old one.

(You should listen to this whole album, btw; it's really good.)

And, as a bonus, here's a different recording of that last one!
