Of course I believed it, even though it didn't all add up. Like:
1. What were two randos doing wandering around at 2am or whatever,
2. with a thing of bleach,
3. and also a white noose,
4. when apparently it was cold as shit that night?


But of course I believed it. [Hate crimes *are* on the rise.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/us/hate-crimes-rising-jussie-smollett/index.html) We *do* live in a country with a racist and homophobic president and vice president. [This *is*](https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/1091202682604478464) [what happens.](https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/1091202682604478464) And so of course I believed it: the whole narrative fit so perfectly into my cognitive priors. I fell victim to *precisely* the same flavor of confirmation bias that we Enlightened Liberals are always accusing our Benighted Conservative Friends of. We all did. Let's own that.

So now I'm mad. I'm so mad. This whole thing just plays right into every stereotype about The Libs With Their Fake Victim Complexes and I just know we're going to be hit with dumbfuck arguments about False Flag Operations for the next billionty years. I'm so mad at Jussie Smollett for shoving us all into this, the most stupidest timeline. I'm so mad at Jussie Smollet for lying to us.

And now we're doing the dumbest shit in response to the revelations that Jussie Smollett made it up. For instance: We're engaging in stupid whataboutism with the whole Christopher Hasson thing. It's *precisely* the same flavor of dumb whataboutism that we Enlightened Liberals are always accusing Trump of. Let's not do that.

We claim to be more logical. Let's act like it.
