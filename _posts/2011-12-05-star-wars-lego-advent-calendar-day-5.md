So I just looked at my blog stats. I have 193 views today. This is a much larger number than any other number of views I have ever had. This is fun! Thanks for reading!

Today's Lego is pretty awesome:

Can you tell what it is? I knew that I recognized it, and that it was some sort of flying thing, but I couldn't remember what it was called, so I googled and googled until my googler was sore.

There's a list on Wookieepedia (such a great name) of like every flying vehicle in Star Wars ever, including all the books and comics and non-canon stuff. I clicked through a bunch of those but my attention span didn't last particularly long, so I went back to google. The google term with which I finally struck paydirt was "brown and green star wars vehicle." That got me to this picture:

It's totally [Boba Fett's ship](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Slave_I)! I'm stoked about this. And now that I know that it's Boba Fett's ship, I can put it into its correct flying orientation:

This is a totally cool Lego. The fins swivel and everything! I think it may have to turn into an ornament for my ghetto Christmas tree.

Aw, isn't my tree awesome? You can't tell in this picture but I made a garland out of dental floss and sea shells.

So here's a thing, though. The guys who designed the Legos clearly didn't care a whit for scale. I mean, this is almost exactly the same size as Mr. Squidface:

[![](http://sbagleysd.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cimg0057.jpg?w=300 "CIMG0057")](http://sbagleysd.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cimg0057.jpg)

I'ma exercise my incredible Photoshop (okay, GIMP) skills and stick the scaled-up Squidward in a picture of the real Slave I so you can see just how big he'd be:

Let's slap some numbers on this thing. Wookieepedia says that the Slave I is 21.5 meters long - that's 70 feet! Calamari-san is huge! This is a scale usually reserved for, y'know, other vaguely Japanese things...
