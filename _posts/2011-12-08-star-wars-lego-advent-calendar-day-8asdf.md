This guy could be any one of the X-wing pilots, but I'ma go ahead and say that he's Wedge Antilles, because Wedge Antilles is the most badass of all the X-wing pilots not named Luke Skywalker, and this is clearly not Luke Skywalker. Also, because his call-sign is Red 2, and you know how cool that makes him:

I was up until 2 this morning writing that stupid essay, and I am fading rapidly. Accordingly, I'm going to finish writing this post and go to bed. Another Lego adventure awaits us all tomorrow!
