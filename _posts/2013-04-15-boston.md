[![boston](http://sbagleysd.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/boston.jpg?w=300)](http://sbagleysd.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/boston.jpg)There is only one thing to write words about today.

This is not a novel thought, but at times like this it always gives me a bit of comfort to know that people ran toward the sound of the blast. NPR did an interview with a trauma surgeon at Beth Israel Deaconess who was off duty and doing something else when he got a text from his son informing him about the blast. He immediately went down to the ER and scrubbed up, to find a bunch of other off-duty surgeons already there. There was this guy [Carlos Arredondo](http://www.ibtimes.com/meet-carlos-arredondo-cowboy-hat-wearing-hero-boston-marathon-bombing-1194089#) who immediately rushed to the spot and started helping with triage; there's this incredible picture of him next to a guy in a wheelchair, [*pinching the guy's femoral artery shut*](http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/4/15/16/enhanced-buzz-16221-1366057120-14.jpg). (That link is a picture. Don't click if you don't want to see exactly what you just read.) A bunch of people started [offering up their frequent flyer miles](http://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/1cfdwa/boston_marathon_explosions_live_update_thread_4/c9fyjxr) for people who needed to get into Boston. People opened their homes to displaced marathoners. Here's [a tweet](https://twitter.com/ElPelonTaqueria/status/323920515184078848) from a local restaurant offering wifi, food, and drinks on a "pay only if you can" basis. The [#bostonhelp](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bostonhelp&src=hash) hashtag is all over twitter.

Patton Oswalt [said it really well today](https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655): "Every once in awhile, the wiring of a tiny sliver of the species gets snarled and they're pointed towards darkness. But the vast majority stands against that darkness and, like white blood cells attacking a virus, they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evil doers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak. This is beyond religion or creed or nation. We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil."

Mr. Rogers [said it really well a long time ago](http://www.fredrogers.org/FRC/par-tragic-events.html): "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, "Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping." To this day, especially in times of "disaster," I remember my mother's words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world."

Sometimes people do bad things, but oddly enough, that's often when you see *more* people doing *the best* things.
