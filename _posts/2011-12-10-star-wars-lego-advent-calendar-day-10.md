Guys, I had way too much fun taking pictures for this post. :D

Today's Lego is another one of the iconic flying vehicles of the original Star Wars series!

If you know what it is, award yourself 7 points. If you don't know what it is, watch this video:

Just kidding - Youtube does not have a video of the original quote that is not [dubbed in French](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCp9nD7jI04). Instead, read this quote: "I used to bullseye womp-rats in my T-16 back home. They're not much bigger than two meters."

Yay, it's a ~~womp rat~~ T-16! [EDIT: As mcnutcase and imwacco have noted below, it's pretty clear that this is a Lambda-class shuttle instead. I bow to their superior nerdery. :D ] Let's make Wedge put it together again with his trusty wrench!

Wedge, are you sure you should be lifting something that heavy with one hand?? "Mehhhh, it's fiiiiine. I got this."

Moments later, TRAGEDY STRIKES:

"AAAGHGGHGHG MY HAND (and also my forearm)!!" (This actually happened, it wasn't engineered, I promise, and it made me laugh a lot.)

While Wedge gets patched up, Chewbacca will put things together. With a hammer. Because he don't use no sissy wrench. Also, he can lift much larger things than Wedge can without catastrophic forearm detachment.

Here it is, all put together! Also, note that Wedge is so hard-core that he bandaged his own forearm back on. With a wrench. NBD. Ain't nobody tellin' Wedge to cut the chatter now, are they.

Here's all the flying vehicles so far lined up together:

And finally, the idea for this picture made me laugh pretty hard, and the picture itself is making me laugh even harder.

Tune in tomorrow for more head-switching, emergency surgery, and hitting things with hammers!
