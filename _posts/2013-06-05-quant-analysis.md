So I'm meeting with my advisor on Friday and have to have something productive to show for myself but I can't brain enough right now to do the qualitative analysis I was planning on, so I'm doing some quant stuff instead. The problem is there's so much quant stuff to do that I keep starting to do one thing but distracting myself with something else. So I'm going to make a list here so that I can be more focused.
* ANOVA test/homework fairness questions (DONE)
* Import and link Calc 2 roster data (DONE)
	+ Clean data so that it doesn't have a bunch of RedIDs for which I have nothing other than an indicator of their Spring 13 enrollment status (DONE - More annoying than I'd thought)
	+ Recalculate persistence
* How do various sub-populations compare in various outcomes across the four treatments? This is a big question that uses a lot of two-way between-groups ANOVA.
	+ Sub-populations: people who've never had calculus before; gender; race/ethnicity; quartiles on CCR; quartiles on ACT/SAT...
		- Made a variable for the kind of calculus people have had before.
	+ Outcomes: beliefs items; final grade; score on final exam; CCI score; CCI normalized gain; persistence...
* Link focus group protocol items to post-term survey items (DONE-ish. No analyses conducted yet but I know which FG items correspond to which survey items.)
* Learn R and the IRT packages for R; conduct IRT analysis of CCI items


I'm sure I'll think of more things but this is a good list for right now.
