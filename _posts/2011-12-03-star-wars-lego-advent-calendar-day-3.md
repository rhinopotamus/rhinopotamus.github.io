Welcome back to Day 3 of Star Wars Legos! Today I am hoping for:

a) something to put Squidward's head on;

b) something to occupy Squidward's empty hands; or

c) both!

Well, it must just be my lucky day, because I totally got --

-- a, uh ... well, I really have no idea what the hell this is supposed to be. But, maybe it will have extra bits for Calamari-san to hold. Those black claw things look promising.

Yep, so, I still have no idea what this is supposed to be. Maybe it is supposed to be one of them [rolly shooty droids](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Droideka), but there is no characteristic curvy head thing, and also no blasters. Maybe it is the bottom half of a rolly shooty droid? Oh well, let's look on the bright side: extra black claw thing for Squidhead!

"Feel the wrath of my poky claw and despaaaaair! <mouth keeps moving>"

Also, it looks like this would be a great time for Squidward's first head transplantation:

The thing that amuses me so much about Calamari-san is how angry he always looks. "My head is on a clawed walker-thing that looks like it could scale sheer rock faces or disembowel a Tauntaun. I hate everything." Or, "dammit, I got a giant claw-dagger weapon instead of the blaster I asked for for Christmas."
