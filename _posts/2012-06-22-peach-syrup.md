Ralph's had California peaches on sale for 99 cents a pound the other day, so I bought some to make peach syrup with. I eat it on sourdough pancakes and it is amazing. Apparently you can also pour it in your smoothies, but I haven't tried this.

Stuff you'll need:
* 4 lbs peaches
* 2 C sugar
* 2 T lemon juice


Peel and cut up the peaches and put them in a blender. Mash them down with your fist so that the blades can get a hold of them (a wooden spoon would work too, but this is much less viscerally satisfying). You want 5C puree; you'll probably have to add a few peaches after you puree it down a bit.

Once you've pureed the peaches, go grab a heavy pot that you think is big enough to hold all of this. Then put it away and grab a bigger one. No, seriously, learn from my mistake. When this stuff hits 212 degrees, [you're going to see some serious shit.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFT7hNhop7w) If your pan is too small it will boil over and make a giant mess under your stove burner. If you don't have a bigger pan, do it in two batches.

Combine the peaches, the sugar, and the lemon juice in the pot and turn it to medium-high-ish heat. Stir it consistently while it heats up. Juuuuust when it starts to boil, and a pale-colored foam starts collecting between the places where the bubbles come up, kill the heat and skim off most of this foam. (Some people will add a teaspoon or two of vanilla extract at this point; I'm not a huge fan personally.)

Pour the syrup into glass jars, or whatever. It keeps well in the freezer, but some people like to do the whole pressure-canning thing. I'm not going to tell you how to do that because I have no real idea. If you're going for the freezer or refrigerator, let it cool for a while before you put it in there.

This recipe makes about this much golden, delicious goodness:

Those are pint jars. Note that I lost a bit of syrup to the boiling-over I warned you about earlier; your second pint will probably be a bit fuller than mine.

Some people will freeze this in freezer bags or ice cube trays; I guess that works too.
