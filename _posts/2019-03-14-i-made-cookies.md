They are cakey and extremely chocolaty, being constructed with both cocoa powder and melted chocolate, and they have some of that good good Mexican hot chocolate flavor. I modified [this recipe](https://hostthetoast.com/death-by-chocolate-chunk-cookies/). I'm not going to tell you a long story about them because you just want to see the recipe. Yields 3 dozen.
* 1 stick unsalted butter
* 4 oz bar unsweetened chocolate
* 3/4 C brown sugar
* 1/2 C granulated sugar


[Brown your butter.](https://www.thekitchn.com/basic-techniques-how-to-brown-77018) (I mean, always.) While the butter is browning, chop the chocolate. Once the butter is browned, take it off the heat and throw the chocolate in. Stir until all the chocolate is melted, then add the sugars and stir until mostly dissolved. Set aside to cool to room temperature.
* 2 C flour
* 1/2 C cocoa powder
* 1 t baking soda
* 2 t cornstarch
* 1/2 t salt
* 1 t cinnamon
* Hefty pinch cayenne


Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Sift the cocoa powder when you add it, because it's always so lumpy. The chocolate mixture is probably cool by now.
* 2 large eggs
* 1 t vanilla extract


Whisk these into the chocolate mixture until well combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and fold until everything is nicely combined. Last ingredient:
* One 3.5 or 4 oz bar of good-quality dark chocolate


You want something you'd eat on its own. I used a Trader Joe's dark chocolate truffle bar. Chop this roughly into chunks, and mash it into the dough with your hands until well-distributed. Put the dough in the refrigerator for half an hour or so.

Preheat the oven to 325°F. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto parchment, then smash them down a little with the heel of your hand. They won't spread much after this, so you don't have to space them very far apart. Bake 15-16 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. You're looking for the tops to crack and the edges to just set.

Yields 3 dozen.
