title: Panicking about AI is a form of cop shit

This is a post about the ongoing panicky doomsaying by professors in reaction to things like ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Wolfram|Alpha, Google Translate, and other forms of AI. The thesis of this post is that the panicky doomsaying reaction is a form of cop shit. As my audience tends to mostly be mathematicians, I'll structure my argument in a comforting and familiar manner.




Definition 1.1 (after [Moro](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-13-against-cop-shit/) and [Brousseau](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~rwilson/Courses/Math903/Brousseau.pdf)):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**Cop shit** is any pedagogical philosophy, technique, or technology that structures a learning situation into a game in which there is a perception of an adversarial relationship between students and instructors.




### Example 1.2




Proctorio, Honorlock, and other remote proctoring systems structure exams as a game in which, according to the proctor's perspective, the role of the student is to cheat and the role of the instructor is to prevent students from cheating. (Observation: remote proctoring systems are a modern panopticon. Less formal observation: [this is cop shit to the max](https://twitter.com/sbagley/status/1320110767929085952).)




### Example 1.3




Letter grades structure a course into a game in which the role of the student is to achieve the maximum grade possible with the minimal amount of work, and the role of the instructor is to award the student the minimum grade that is supportable by evidence.




### Example 1.4




Laptop policies structure each class session into a game in which the role of the student is to use their technology devices as much as possible, and the role of the instructor is to catch them using their technology devices inappropriately.




Theorem 1.5
-----------




Panicky doomsaying about ChatGPT and similar AI things is cop shit.




*Proof.* Our job in this proof is to identify a game that's being played in which professors and students are on opposite sides. The argument is essentially that each assessment that an instructor is worried about being ChatGPT'd becomes such a game. An instructor perceives a threat: students can use AI to produce work that would trick the instructor into assigning a higher grade than would be merited by what the student can produce unaided. Therefore, the instructor assigns themselves the role of detecting and opposing such use, and gets panicky precisely because their task now seems impossible. More to the point of the proof: the instructor has now assigned themselves a role that's adversarial to the role they are imagining for the student, which is to complete the assignment with minimal work. Thus we've satisfied the definition of cop shit, \qed. 




So what should we do about this? How should this theorem make us think and act? I have some thoughts about that, but they'll have to wait for the next blog post.
