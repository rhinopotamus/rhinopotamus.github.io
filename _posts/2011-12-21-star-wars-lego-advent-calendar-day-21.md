Hey look, a post that's coming in on time and everything! I know, crazy, huh. Potentially even shocking!

We're coming up on the end of the Star Wars Lego advent calendar. This is sad, but on Monday, several friends and I are going to watch the Star Wars movies. Of course I am bringing all the Legos. Pictures will be taken, and summarily posted on this blog.

Today's Lego is pretty awesome:

Iiiiiiiiit's the Millennium Falcon! I would say that you can make it with less than 12 bricks, but it actually takes 13. Chewie is going to put this one together. With a hammer, and a tire iron.

And here's him hammering the canopy on:

"AAAAGGHGHHGOOOGHGHOOOORRRAAAGHGH\*" (\*"If I had a hammer, I'd-a hammer in the mo-or-nin'...")

It's amazing what Chewie can accomplish with a hammer.
