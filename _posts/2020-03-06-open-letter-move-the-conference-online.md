I'm currently helping organize the MAA Intermountain Sectional meeting at Westminster College on March 27-28. Here's an open letter about why I think we should move the conference online; I'm sending this letter to the local organizer Jonas D'Andrea and a couple of other people in section leadership. I think more people than just us will benefit from reading this argument, though, which is why I'm blogging it as well.

Hi all,

I was chatting with Jonas D'Andrea today over lunch about potential actions we might want to take with the conference in light of COVID-19. I said during lunch that I thought we should consider moving the conference online, but the more I think about it, the more strongly I feel: **Let's move the conference online, and let's announce it now.**
### The present situation


It's time for us to be clear-eyed about the present situation. COVID-19 is in the United States, and it's here to stay. Every state, including Utah, will be impacted; we're too interconnected to believe otherwise. The curve will not integrate to zero. The best we can do right now is work to flatten out the curve. We owe it to our colleagues in public health to believe them and trust their science.

Our colleagues in public health are telling us that we should take common-sense measures to help flatten the curve: wash your hands, cover your sneeze, maybe replace the ritual of handshaking with something else. One of our public health colleagues' most important recommendations is to avoid making a bunch of people congregate together. Let's learn from the lesson of [Philadelphia's Liberty Parade.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) Let's not make people gather together in person and sneeze on each other for a weekend in late March. There is a nonzero chance that if we do that, **somebody will die** as a result.

There has been some discussion of putting it to a vote. I think this is a good way for us, the organizers, to shirk our responsibility to make hard decisions. The buck has to stop somewhere, and if it's not with us, then I don't know who. **We have the responsibility** to make the hard decision.
### We should do it now


The longer we wait, the more people firm up their plans, the more people register, the more contracts we sign, the more plane tickets people buy, and the more money everyone is out. What's more, the longer we wait, the less time we have to plan for something different. **Let's pull the trigger and let's do it today.**It's the responsible choice, and we are responsible.
### This is of course a bummer...


Academic conferences are a lot of fun. There are a lot of opportunities during conferences to socialize with old friends, learn new things, and build new networks.  If you aren't meeting together in person, you don't have the opportunities for chance encounters in the halls. All of this is true and I will be sad not to have these opportunities.
### ... but it's also an amazing opportunity


You'll notice that I'm very carefully not saying that we should **cancel** the conference. On the contrary, we should **move the conference online.** We have, suddenly dropped in our laps, some very strong motivation to **conduct a grand experiment**, and to help design the future of the academic conference.

There are many reasons why the traditional academic conference model is problematic. Nobody will be surprised about these. I'm not raising any new concerns. These are well-known problems.
* Conferences prompt a whole lot of **airplane travel**. We owe it to our colleagues in climate science to believe their science, and they're telling us that we should be really mindful of the [effects on global climate](https://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) of hopping in a plane and flying across the country for a couple of days.
* Conferences are often **inaccessible** to people with disabilities. This is an [ongoing concern](https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/) that a lot of professional societies are spending a lot of time thinking about. People with disabilities [have been telling us](https://twitter.com/karriehiggins/status/1235694680949641217) for a while now that we need to do things better.
* Conferences are **expensive**, and thus **elitist**. A large R1 institution has a lot more money to spend on professional travel than a small school, so professors from large R1 institutions get to go to more conferences than those at small schools, and thus give more presentations, and thus reap more professional benefits. I've been to two conferences this year, and since our travel awards at Westminster are capped at $1000, which *almost* covers registration and hotel, I paid out of pocket for the flight for the first one and *everything* for the second. This is not a situation that a professor at an R1 institution faces.


None of these problems are new, but all of them are thrown into stark relief by the present public health crisis, which suddenly gives us some **life-or-death** motivation to address them. Let's explore some solutions to these problems, yes?
### The internet exists


We've made incredible advances in telepresence in the last few years, and it's incredible to me how little advantage professional societies have taken of it. Notably, telepresence solves all three of the problems I identified above:
* Telepresence means **you don't have to travel**. You can attend the conference from your couch in your living room. Forget carbon footprint, you're not even putting shoes on.
* Telepresence **solves accessibility concerns.** People with disabilities don't have to worry about whether the room is accessible if it is in fact their room.
* Telepresence means that conferences can be **radically open**. Because we're eliminating the barrier of expensive travel, a heck of a lot more people suddenly find themselves in a position where they can attend. In fact, why not even remove borders altogether, and invite anyone who's interested to join in?


To be sure, there are problems with telepresence, but based on my experience lately, these problems are way less severe than I think we fear they are.
### People are already doing this


There is a biweekly MIT seminar, the [Electronic Seminar on Mathematics Education](https://math.mit.edu/seminars/esme/), that is (a) excellent, (b) free and open to all, and (c) conducted entirely by Zoom. I've attended regularly and watched recordings of sessions I couldn't attend live, and it's a great seminar. If MIT is doing it, why can't we?

Our colleagues at the University of Utah are currently running a seminar on [mathematics education and teaching.](http://www.math.utah.edu/seminars/mathed/) They invited a speaker to present by Zoom because she is pregnant and doesn't want to travel. By all accounts this went great. Another speaker will be presenting via telepresence in April. If Utah is doing it, why can't we?

People are worried about glitchy connections and lag and delay. I'm saying that (a) these problems are way less present now than they were even five years ago, and (b) I'd much rather deal with those problems than with **people maybe dying**from COVID-19.
### Decision errors


It's entirely possible that moving the conference online is a Type 1 error. But let's weigh the competing risks of the Type 1 error versus the Type 2 error. If we make the Type 1 error, and move the conference online, worst-case scenario: maybe some people will lose money on nonrefundable plane tickets, maybe the technology won't work how we want it to, and maybe people will be sad and mad at us.

If we make the Type 2 error, and let the conference go on in person as scheduled, worst-case scenario: maybe people will be exposed to COVID-19, and **maybe people will die.**

I would much rather make the Type 1 error, because nobody will die from it.
### Let's join the grand experiment


Let's move this conference online. Let's take the opportunity to experiment and try new things. Let's carefully document what we do, what works, what doesn't work, what problems we encounter, and what solutions we create. Let's ask our friends and colleagues who are already moving to telepresence what lessons they've learned. Let's write all this stuff down and **publish it**.

I bet we can still deliver an exciting, stimulating, scientifically meaningful conference, all online, for less total cost to the section (we're not paying for space or for coffee) and to the attendees (they won't be paying for a hotel). I bet we can learn some interesting lessons that can improve academic conferences for years to come. I bet that all of us smart academic types can put our heads together and come up with interesting solutions to problems that extend way beyond our particular situation.

But most importantly, the counter-bet is way less tenable.The counter-bet is a wager that COVID-19 won't reach Utah by March 27, and the chips on the table are, and I promise I am not being dramatic, **people's lives**. If we bet wrong, **people might die.**That's not a bet I'm willing to make.

So: Let's be responsible, and let's try something cool. **Let's move this conference online, and let's do it today.**
