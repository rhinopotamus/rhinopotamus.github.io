Hello, my friend Raven;  

it's so good to hear you  

up on the balcony, croaking your song.  

  

Such a strong voice you have,  

gravel and leather,  

the tongue of the desert I feel I must know.  

  

How handsome your feathers,  

so carefully preened,  

the rainbow-slick sheen from the light of the sun.  

  

What a fine figure you cut  

taking flight,  

obsidian wings on the sapphire sky.
