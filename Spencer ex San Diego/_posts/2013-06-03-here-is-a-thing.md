I was leaving the UCSD campus and decided to print off several articles I need to read before Wednesday. I walked into the APM mailroom/printer room, and there were two other people, one of whom left just as I was walking in. I got my computer open and was starting to find the pdfs I needed to print, when the second guy opened the door to walk out, reached for the light switch, and turned off the light. With, y'know, me still standing there in the room.

As the door slowly closed and the light from the hall grew gradually dimmer, I made some noises like "Uh - I - were you - um -" and he rushed back in and was like "Oh I'm so sorry, I forgot about you!"
