This is my grandfather's recipe and I love them. I make them biiiiiig and fluffy in a cast-iron skillet and top them with peach syrup. Sometimes I have even put ice cream on the top because I'm an adult and nobody can tell me not to.

Wet
* 1 1/2 C mature sourdough starter (350g; feed 8-10 hours before starting)
* 2 eggs
* 2 T sugar
* 2 T melted butter / oil
* 1 C buttermilk


Dry
* 1 1/2 t salt
* 1 t soda
* 1 C flour
