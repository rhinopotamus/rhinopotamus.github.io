I was on a mission to go to the elementary school and get some of the popcorn they use to feed their class hamsters. I noticed I was wearing a shirt with a personally-identifiable URL on it, and concluded I would have to wear it inside-out and burn the shirt after the mission was over. Then I saw Alex Trebek, who was picking up his kid from school, and Don Eisenbarth posted about it on Facebook.
