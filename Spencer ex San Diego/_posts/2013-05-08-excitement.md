Do you ever get way too excited about something that may not actually be happening, and you keep telling yourself not to get way too excited, but you do it anyway because you can't help yourself, and you're at once bracing yourself for extreme disappointment and enjoying the ride?

For instance, my roommate might be buying a house. It's apparently a great deal. He's trying not to be all stoked about it but I can tell he is.

There is another ~~Skywalker~~ for instance (sorry, I couldn't help myself) but I don't feel about talking about it right now. :)
