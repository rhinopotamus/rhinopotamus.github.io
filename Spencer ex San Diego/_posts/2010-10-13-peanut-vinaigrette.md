I had some leftover little strips of chicken, and I decided I was going to put them on a salad for lunch today. I then remembered that I had some leftover [peanut sauce](http://sbagleysd.wordpress.com/2010/09/27/thai-peanut-sauce/) in the fridge, and wondered if I could turn it into a good vinaigrette.

So, I took maybe 1-1.5 T of this sauce, mixed it with white wine vinegar (rice vinegar probably would have been even better, but I don't have any yet) until it was runny, added just a drop of sesame oil and the juice from a quarter of a lime, and it was fantastic. :9
