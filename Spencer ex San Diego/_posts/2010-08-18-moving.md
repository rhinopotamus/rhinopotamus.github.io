Embarrassingly many years ago, I made [a blog](http://tophatrabbit.blogspot.com) on Blogger. That blog has served me well, but I've been casting a longing eye at the rolling green pastures of Wordpress for some time now. I'm moving from Salt Lake to San Diego for grad school, so I figure now is a good time to relocate my blog as well.

I'm not sure exactly what this blog is going to end up being about. If you read it, you will probably be subjected to recipes, pedagogical theories, funny stories, and anything else that isn't going to fit in a Facebook status update.
