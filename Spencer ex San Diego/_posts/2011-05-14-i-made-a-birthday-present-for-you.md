(It was my birthday yesterday.)

Behold: [The Internet's version of a mixtape!](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL0473F38FBF76A02B)

A startling amount of good music came out in or near the summer of 2005. I put together 20-some of the songs I remember listening to during that summer. Enjoy listening!

(NB: Several of the videos are also really great - in particular, you should watch the ones for Middle of Nowhere and E-Pro. The one for Doesn't Remind Me is very well made but kinda depressing.)
