(Wordpress just said "Beep beep boop" while it prepared this page for me. That made me happy. I always need more deliberate whimsy in my life.)

On Sunday I jumped in the car and drove to my new home for the next year at least. I've been collecting some thoughts, observations, and stories over the last week or so about the move, with the aim of compiling them in a blog post. So here goes!

* I drove I-80 through Cheyenne and then down I-25. I was originally going to go US-40 through Vernal and then to US-34 through Rocky Mountain National Park, but I ended up getting a later start than I wanted, so I took the quicker route.
* It's been a while since I've driven I-80 through Evanston, so I had forgotten how pretty the stretch just past Echo Reservoir is. The highway follows a cut through red rocks and pine trees, which is a lovely combination -- especially because I'm more used to the drive through southern Utah, where it's just plain red rocks (and maybe some sagebrush if you're lucky).
* The drive through Wyoming is a whole lot of boring flatlands punctuated by sudden moments of ridiculous beauty. As soon as you get past Evanston, there's a solid hour of nothing interesting, but then suddenly at Green River there's this ridiculous bluff that pops up out of nowhere and a cool tunnel through a mountain, and then there's nothing again for two hours, and suddenly there's this really interesting mountain that just stands out all by itself, and then an hour of boring, and then you climb out of Laramie through this gorgeous red rock pass, and on top of the pass there's this plateau with these neat rock outcroppings all over.
* I'm always amused by flipping through radio stations out in the middle of nowhere, just to see what's on the dial. Usually, at any given point in Wyoming, there is a Jesus station, an NPR station, and some country music.
* On that subject: I think that in order to understand country music, you really have to drive through some flatlands under that clear blue sky you only get in the summer. I don't particularly like country music (with the exception of Johnny Cash and sometimes Garth Brooks), but I do appreciate how it captures the feeling of expanse that's found in these places.
* When I got my uhaul box I found that my spice box had fallen over and disgorged its contents all over everything else. Not a big deal, except for the fact that my cumin is in a bottle whose lid has been broken for quite a long time. So now a bunch of my stuff smells like cumin. I wish it had been basil or something because damn but cumin is pungent.
* My landlord is basically the coolest.
* I now own a kitchen table and six chairs. SIX! That means I can invite five people over and have chairs for all of them! There is not room in my kitchen for six chairs so I'm going to have to scatter a few throughout my house.
* I also now own a coffee table and it makes me feel like an adult at least a little bit.
* Have been feeling a little insecure lately because my new town is a little smaller, a little countrier, and maybe a little less tolerant than San Diego.
* Have also been feeling really lucky and really happy lately, for other reasons that I don't particularly feel like disclosing.

Running out of steam. Maybe more later.
