Recipe modified from [here](https://whatscookingamerica.net/Bread/PizzaDoughSourdough.htm). I find that it makes two personal size, or else you can double this recipe and get three pretty nice-size shells.
* 1 1/2 C mature starter (350g; feed 8-10 hours before starting)
* 1 Tbsp olive oil (10g)
* 1 Tbsp sugar (10g) -- this helps it brown
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 C bread flour (200g)


Also try 275g starter and 150g flour; then you can roll it out thinner and get a little crispier bake.

Depending on the humidity in the air, the water content in your starter, and the phase of the moon, you may need to add some water. You're looking for a dough that's sticky but cleans the bowl.

Bake hot - like at least 475°F. These freeze well if you par-bake them, and the dough will keep in the refrigerator for a couple of days (but beware of off-gassing!).

EDIT: I've found that the dough behaves much nicer if you let it ferment in the refrigerator at least overnight. So, make the dough at least the day before you want pizza.
