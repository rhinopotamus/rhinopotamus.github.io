The other day in class we were talking about something having to do with weighted averages[^1]. As a familiar example of weighted averages, I had people [calculate a weighted GPA](https://activecalculus.org/single/sec-6-3-mass.html#lVm) for warmup (with weights given by credit hours). While we were discussing this calculation, I mentioned that I think GPAs are wack and we shouldn't use them, but that I wasn't going to get on my soapbox about this. So then a student asked about this on my daily exit quiz:

![Canvas quiz question: "Ask me one question." The student has written, "What is your opinion on GPA? You mentioned your opinion breifly." I have replied: "Oh friend, you absolutely do not know the pandora's box you are cracking open, lol"](/images/gpa-exit-quiz.png)

I thought it would be fun to write a brief blog post summarizing something I said in my response to the question. All philosophical disagreements aside (and I have plenty of those), there is a *specific mathematical / statistical* reason why the GPA calculation is flawed. 

## Levels of measurement

Probably you have heard in a statistics class or something that statisticians like to separate measures or scales into four categories: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Each of these levels of measurement is in some way a refinement of the previous:
- A nominal scale just allows you to *distinguish* between values on the scale.
- An ordinal scale allows you to both distinguish *and rank* values on the scale.
- An interval scale allows you to distinguish, rank, *and subtract* values on the scale. (There is a consistent notion of *difference* between each value on the scale.)
- A ratio scale allows you to distinguish, rank, subtract, *and divide* values on the scale. 

## Grade points as a scale

[^1]: The center of mass of a system of point masses in one dimension. If you don't want to say a bunch of physics words about net torque, you can instead think of this as a weighted average of the locations of the masses with weights given by each mass.
