Hi algebraists,

I am sensing that it may be the time in the semester for me to deliver the following very strange pep talk. At first, it is not going to sound much like a pep talk, but bear with me, because it'll come back around. The pep talk consists of three parts:

## Part 1: You suck at proofs

The proofs I have looked at so far on the first few homeworks have generally been pretty bad. There's a lot of assuming-the-conclusion, there's some wacky use of quantifiers, there's the thing where you accidentally assume that the group is abelian, there's accidentally only proving part of the theorem, there's lines that don't follow from the previous sentence, there's extraneous variables, there's unnecessary complications, there's "spitballing" aka long human-words sentences that seek to obscure that you haven't quite nailed down the key idea -- I could go on.

"Why are you being so mean to us in that paragraph?", you sniffle. I promise I'm not: indeed, I hasten to add that *everybody* has turned in *at least* one or two expert-level complete correct proofs. What I'm doing with this litany of errors is trying to give you a realistic picture of where you're currently at.

## Part 2: It is currently correct for you to suck at proofs

Indeed, if you didn't suck at proofs, (a) I would be very surprised and (b) I would wonder why you were bothering to take this class. It is correct for you to suck at proofs *because you're 4-ish weeks into a class about proofs*. If you were 4-ish weeks into an underwater basket-weaving class, would you expect to be producing beautiful Longabergers? If you were 4-ish weeks into playing tennis, would you expect to be Serena Williams?

The main reason you suck at proofs is that, besides learning abstract algebra content, you are learning how to write proofs. Even if you have successfully written proofs in other classes, what makes a good *abstract algebra* proof is often a bit different from what makes a good proof in whatever other class.

As a rule of thumb, at this stage, you should generally expect that *most* of your proofs have at least *something* wrong with them. "What percentage of proofs, and how wrong?" you ask, and I gently smile and refuse to give any quantitative answer because that is specifically not my point.

## Part 3: The way to get better at proofs is to embrace sucking at proofs

The key feature of human learning is learning from mistakes. This requires making mistakes and receiving feedback about them, either from another person or from the world itself. (You learn how long to cook a pancake by burning a pancake.) I am inviting you to recalibrate your confidence level so that (a) you can more productively engage with feedback and (b) you aren't holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.

### Part 3a: Embracing sucking at proofs helps you improve

If you think that you are awesome at proofs, then whenever someone tells you that your proof is incorrect, your immediate set of emotions will be mostly negative. In particular, it may include such things as anger ("how dare that person impugn  my beautiful proof and/or my honor"), self-righteousness ("they just don't understand my beautiful and perfect thoughts"), dismissal ("they clearly don't know what they're talking about"), or even humiliation ("because of this error, my proof is worthless and so am I and I shall thus fling myself into a volcano"). I think if you pause and reflect about these emotions for a hot second, you'll see that each one of them is a *direct impediment* to learning from mistakes.

(Indeed, even if you think you *should* be awesome at proofs but you aren't, then you often feel this same set of negative emotions, but this time *pointed at yourself*. I don't think I need to tell you why that's bad, either for learning or for, like, being.)

If, instead, you walk into the situation with the idea that your proof is likely to be flawed, then suddenly you have the room to engage with emotions like surprise ("oh wow, I *can* make this work for infinite groups!"), satisfaction ("oh nice, removing that extraneous $k$ makes my proof much easier to read"), and pride ("hell yeah, the part I felt good about was indeed right"). 

### Part 3b: Embracing sucking at proofs allows you to suck

I think a lot of the time, when you leave something blank or say "I don't even know where to start" or similar, it's actually because you're experiencing these incorrect expectations and the negative emotions associated with them. Releasing the expectation that you're already great at proofs allows you to release those
