Pappus did not have access to the machinery of calculus. How did he prove this result without it? 

Thanks to the magic of interlibrary loan, I was able to look at Alexander Jones's translation of the relevant piece of Pappus's work. Here's what Pappus writes about his theorem, in Jones's translation:

> The ratio of solids of complete revolution is compounded of that of the revolved figures and that of the straight lines similarly drawn to the axes from the centers of gravity in them.
